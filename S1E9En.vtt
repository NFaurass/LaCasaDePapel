WEBVTT

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.040
SUNDAY
03:15 PM

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.720
53 HOURS OF ROBBERY

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.400
"Known for perpetrating numerous robberies
at jeweller’s and luxury shops,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.560
Andrés de Fonollosa is also responsible
for other sexual offences."

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.480
What a curriculum!

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.200
Andrés de Fonollosa.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.480
Who would have thought?

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.800
Such a refinement

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.120
and that stick you seem
to have stuck up your bottom.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.640
In the end, it turns out to be
that you like whores.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.040
"In particular, being part
of a ring of women trafficking

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.400
brought in from eastern Europe,
from Albania and Bulgaria,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.440
to be sold later..."

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.880
Did you also taste the Bulgarian women,
eh, before selling them?

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.040
"Procuring, extortion of minors,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.760
-deprivation of liberty..."
-Minors?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.160
-..."as well as the previously mentioned."
-Minors?

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.720
-..."arm robbery."
-Minors.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.240
"Amongst them, the attempted robbery
of a well-known jeweller’s shop

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.240
in Vendôme square."

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.920
You’re a pig.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.000
Can you tell me
why that girl is in your office, tied up?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.240
What are going to do with her,
piece of scum?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.280
"According to the latest news,
Fonollosa has eluded

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.440
this last charge thanks
to his cooperation as an informant."

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.080
Ah, and a snitch, too...

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.920
"...identified by the police
together with Silene Oliveira..."

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.440
I would never sell women.
And much less I would be a pimp.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.400
My ethics code doesn’t let me do it.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.920
The same way it stops me
from telling on a colleague,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.360
despite being such a human waste.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.840
And that’s nothing to do
with my tastes and my likings, Nairobi.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.040
If you say so.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.320
-"...the robbers’ spokesperson.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.280
A fingerprint from Andrés de Fonollosa
has been found

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.000
on a button that the officers found in
a Seat Ibiza linked to the investigation.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.960
-Specialized police units..."
-I’ve never been inside that car.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.040
"...in search for new traces of DNA
that can provide some clues..."

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.320
But I know who did.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.480
What’s the matter?

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.040
What the fuck are you doing
with my jacket, piece of crap?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.440
Fuck you, son of a bitch.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.840
Fucking hell.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.400
Tell me, Nairobi,
do you know where Denver is?

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.720
No.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.040
A bit calmed and slow, aren’t we?
Is it still like this?

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.960
Shall I help you?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.880
The sooner we finish the whole,
the sooner will get out of here.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.920
Are you tired of being here?

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.840
Well.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.760
-This can bore anyone.
-You’re bored with 67 hostages,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.120
firing your M-16 and the cops
outside the door. Is that why?

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.760
Is that why you tried to bite
that poor lamb’s neck?

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.040
And you started kissing her,
while she was scared to death.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.200
What the heck was that for?

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.440
To provoke you.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.920
You are awfully quiet
when you go for a shit.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.040
And what now?

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.160
Are you getting bored of Rio?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.680
-Why do you say that?
-Because you’re that kind of person.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.120
Am I?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.920
What kind of person?

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.680
Of those, one does not want for their son.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.560
Do you remember what happened in Toledo,
the day we had paella?

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.360
It was the night of San Juan and you went
to the street party with no permission.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.600
Yes.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.200
What is it?

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.400
-What’s wrong?
-Say.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.200
What?

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.800
Did you know that there are over
2,000 trillion stars in the sky?

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.160
-So, you have counted them all?
-Of course, man.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.040
I need some more fun, here.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.440
And I know, Tokyo, I know you keep
something similar to this in your room.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.440
-Some.
-Yes. We might as well?

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.480
-Whoa, Rio! Whoa, Rio! Poor...
-Rio, he was ever so drunk.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.800
-Very drunk.
-How dru...

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.960
Will you give me a puff?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.880
Listen.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.920
Why did you tell me that
about the stars earlier on?

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.880
I don’t really know, mate,
because it’s a nice thing.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.320
All the stars up there, like...
I don’t know.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.000
There, in the mountains. I don’t really
know why I told you that, mate.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.680
Nothing else?

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.560
-Nothing else about what?
-I don't know.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.160
That you might mean something else, no?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.440
Something like if you want to fuck with me
or something of that sort?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.680
But... would you like to?

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.640
-Come off, mate.
-What? Piss off!

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.120
Piss off!

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.440
Dad...

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.200
Dad, what are you doing, standing there?

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.640
No, nothing. Nothing,
I was there and you weren’t...

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.920
Where have you been
at this time and like that?

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.040
Shush.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.400
-We are back from the street party.
-Oh, my.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.760
-The street party.
-So you went out from here...

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.160
-We never went to the street party!
-Don’t lie.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.640
We stayed in drinking. Off to bed.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.680
I can’t sleep now.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.160
I can’t sleep,
so I’m going to have a drink, okay?

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.040
Dad, you nod off quickly.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.480
Dad, look at me, look at me. Off to bed.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.800
Go to bed. Listen to me.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.840
-Have you got at ciggie?
-For fuck’s sake!

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.040
-Sure. Here you are, have a smoke.
-Might as well.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.480
-Have this one.
-Come on.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.600
I’m going to the toilet. But, when
I’m back, everyone, to their room.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.600
Come on.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.280
-See if you can have some sleep.
-See you later, dear.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.840
You!

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.000
Couldn’t you see what I was doing
with my eyes so you would leave?

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:56.800
Why?

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.280
You spoiled all the fun, dad.
Fucking shit...

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.040
-Eh... Tokyo and you...?
-Yes, there. There.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.000
-Yes, she’s hot.
-Hot?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.200
She’s gorgeous, dada. She’s gorgeous.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.520
But there’ll be plenty of time.
Now you have to focus.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.720
Focus? I haven’t been more focused
in all my life.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.360
What you have to focus on.
Let’s go to bed.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.480
Fuck me. I’ m not going to sleep
in the same bed with you

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.600
after almost going to sleep
with that goddess.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.640
I’ll sleep in the fucking car.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.200
-No way you’re sleeping in the car?
-Shut up.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.520
You always do the same thing, damn,
you’re always doing that.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.880
And what’s wrong,
I’m not enough for your son?

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.680
I think you’re too much.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.600
Because you live your life
like a videogame.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.000
Robberies, shooting, lovers.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.280
Adventures...

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.040
-Well, yes, I enjoy life.
-No.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.080
You enjoy leaping from one stone
onto another in mud pools.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.040
And after you leap, the stone sinks in.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.720
You leave dead bodies behind
on the hard shoulders.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.760
That’s what you like.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.600
Whose idea was it to rob the security van?
Yours or your boyfriend’s?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.960
Yours, wasn’t it?

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.480
So now your boyfriend is a dead man.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.520
And so is your mother.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.600
I’m sure that you were aware of how much
harm you were doing to your mother.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.560
And now it’s Rio’s turn.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.440
You’re already bored.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.560
On top of that, you touch a young girl up
while holding her at gunpoint.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.040
So irresponsible.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.840
Fickle, superficial, selfish.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.760
How do you define yourself?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.960
If we all do our job and it goes badly,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.520
it’s part of the job.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.640
But if it goes bad because a fickle brat

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.000
wants to leave urgently, I won’t allow it.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.720
So, start working.
We’ve only got 10 days left.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.120
See if once in your life you fucking
finish what you have started.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.880
I dozed off, damn it.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.040
-Yes, I was about to wake you up.
-Have I been sleeping long?

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.760
I don’t know.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.640
The first time I sleep with a girl
and when I wake up, she’s still there.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.200
I don’t know where you expected me to go.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.040
I don’t know where you expected me to go.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.600
Inside a whole with a shot wound in my leg
and amid a kidnapping.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.600
-I don’t have many options, do I?
-What’s wrong?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.640
You needn’t be so rough,
I saved your life.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.120
You saved my life?

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.680
-Yes.
-How did you save my life?

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.080
How? Like the Jews in Auschwitz?

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.560
When a Nazi pulled them off the queue
and they didn’t go to the gas chamber.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.160
I’m not a fucking Nazi, huh?
I’m not a fucking Nazi.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.280
I remind you
that you stole a mobile phone,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.920
-and I was ordered to kill you.
-And what did you do?

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.400
Hey, what did you do?

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.800
You said no, you stopped him? No.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.760
You shot me in the leg.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.120
You humiliated me before everyone.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.960
And now you have locked me up here,
I can’t breathe or go to the toilet.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.680
I go where, in a bucket?

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.160
So, don't make a mistake.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.960
You may be the best out of all the Nazis,
but you still are not one of them.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.880
I’m sorry.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.760
I’m sorry, I wasn’t...

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.040
It wasn’t my intention to humiliate you.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.080
I don’t quite know what to do...
about all this.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.560
I’m going to take you the toilet, okay?
Do you agree?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.840
Okay.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.320
Then, let’s go.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.640
Denver!

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.160
My friend!

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.440
Come here!

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360
Damn it!

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.120
Berlin, wait!

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.720
Berlin, stop!

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.920
Wait, damn it, Berlin!

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.680
Listen to me, stop, stop, stop, stop.
You’re right!

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.680
You’re right.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.840
Denver might have lost
the button of your jacket

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.400
because he put on your jacket,
but, so what?

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.480
-You can’t change that.
-But I can punish him.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:27.960
Berlin.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.960
He’s not resting. He’s not at the museum

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.160
or the tunnel.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.360
Or the printing house.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.200
He’s probably gone
to the street party again?

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.200
Relax, guys, I’ll look for him.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.280
Berlin, please, come to your senses.
Come to your senses, huh?

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.280
You can’t shoot him
because he stole your jacket.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.480
It’s a blotched job. You’re a bloke
with style and that’s a blotched job.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.320
What about my dignity?

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.000
I have a reputation to keep.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.920
My friends from the Costa Azul have seen
my name connected to those lies.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.640
Denver has screwed my honour.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.520
And if someone screws my honour,
I’ll destroy him.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.400
Do you understand?
We’re talking about integrity here.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.080
Ethics... is important, Nairobi.
But... aesthetics, too.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.840
I beg you, please.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.840
Please, don’t screw the plan up for us,
Berlin.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.080
-You fucking scum...
-Eh, eh, eh. Back off.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.000
Nairobi.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.520
-Stay here.
-Helsinki.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.920
What’ll you do, will you shoot me?

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.880
Stay... here.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.080
It was a fucking joke
the whole jacket thing.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.200
It was a fucking joke
the whole jacket thing!

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.480
It was a joke!

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.120
I don’t know if I’m overdoing it
a little with the lipstick.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.800
I might look a bit like a whore.
What do you think?

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.040
-On the contrary, I have a simple look.
-That’s why I’m saying it...

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.000
-Let’s see, where are we heading?
-For the street party.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.840
So, you need to look like
a street... slut.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.040
-What is it?
-We’re partying.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.400
Shush.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.600
-The Professor’s keys?
-I got them.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.880
Oh, the car...

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.360
Fuck!

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.520
Done.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.840
-Where is Denver?
-No idea.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.360
What do you mean, no idea?

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.080
Yes, now we can.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.880
Quiet.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.360
-But, and this?
-This is pure elegance.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.280
-Berlin’s jacket?
-Yes, that’s right.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.160
-He’ll kill you.
-No, he won’t.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.680
Off we go, off we go.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.000
Silence, silence, silence.
Silence, it’s coming... it’s coming to me.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.560
-Shush.
-What are you on about?

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.600
Have I ever told you about my five wives?

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.080
They just want us to impregnate them,
but later...

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.840
what comes out of there...

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.560
is a nuclear warhead.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.600
Stop it, you make me feel nervous!

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.840
You look beautiful.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.440
-I chose an anime look for you.
-I like anime.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.920
What’s the matter?

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.040
Have you been crying.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.320
Who do you think I am?

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.440
The fucking best woman.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.640
I think I am a fickle person
who fucks everyone up.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.240
It’s like I could see myself in a film,
and I didn’t...

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.200
recognize myself.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.080
Because I thought I was...

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.160
different,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.200
but in fact I’m a fucking mad woman
who causes pain,

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.920
and gets bored of everything.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.440
And who doesn’t make people happy.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.600
And I don’t like the way I am,

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.440
nor this fucking book that I saw here
in the CEO’s office.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.640
It says I’m a toxic woman.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.120
If you’re trying to break up with me,
make me go away or something of that sort,

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.360
don’t you dare.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.560
Rio, mate...

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.040
I’m burnt soil.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.120
Worse.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.600
I’m a fucking petrol drum and a match.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.200
I love bonfires.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.200
And if you’re toxic, I’ll feel dizzy.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.440
With a joint, and I’ll enjoy it.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.720
Look here.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.600
When I see you
at the other side of the museum,

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.440
it makes me feel like crying...

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.600
just for being with you.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.920
And we fuck
and I’m floating around the room.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.840
I know you will leave me.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.200
But why don’t we cope with each other
a little longer?

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.760
Does it have to be now?

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.520
No, it doesn’t have to be now.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.080
Start recording.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.800
-And this hair.
-Perfect.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.360
Z-75, to all units.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.840
There is an arm robbery on Alcántara, 33.
It’s a ironmonger’s.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.360
Any unit nearby?

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.600
Unit Z-32, we are just in front
of the door, we’re heading there.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.560
It’s him.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.720
Yes. I’m sure.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.800
Why doesn’t he pick up, where is he?

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.240
I’m in front of Karina's school,
your daughter.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.200
"And people from my organization
are in Krostoma,

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:14.560
watching your wife
coming out of the supermarket."

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.560
If the identikit you are doing

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.760
"looks like me,

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.640
you won’t ever see neither of them."

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.840
Who the hell is on channel 8?

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.200
"The police cannot protect you, Nikolai."

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.920
Let go of that, let go of that! Let go!

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.240
-Fuck!
-Let go of that!

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.960
God! What the heck did he say?
What the heck did he say?

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.200
I didn’t hear anything.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.640
What did he tell you?

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.840
H-50. Control room. Where was
that message in Russian sent from?

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.480
"From a Z, Z-32."

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.880
Z-32, do you read me?

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.640
"This is Z-32 exiting the ironmonger’s.
It was a false robbery call."

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.680
Someone is in your car.
Run to the patrol car.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.240
Control room, indeed,
they went in, but there’s no one now.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.560
He must be near.
Look for someone, a suspect.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.680
Male, 40 years old, has a beard.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.320
"There’s no one nearby. We start to move."

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.680
Denver!

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.360
Denver?

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.800
Denver.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.320
-I was looking for you.
-Here I am.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.280
The thing is...

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.760
my face is constantly
in the TV news report.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.760
Do you know what they say about me?

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.440
-No.
-That I’m thief.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.360
That I can understand,
but they all say I like prostitutes,

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:11.040
I am a procurer, I abuse kids.
And all that because of a button.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.040
A button from my jacket.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.720
Remember? The one you put on.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.400
And apparently you left it behind
inside the car we had in Toledo.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.200
A car that, by the way,
I, I’m sure, wasn’t...

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.720
I was never in.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.320
Do you know what that means?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.640
I don’t know.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.320
-You do know.
-I don’t know.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.280
You have just fucked my life.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.240
Come off.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.640
-What should I do with you?
-Berlin.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.920
I’m sorry, mate,
I didn’t see the fucking button.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.040
I’ll compensate you with 10 or 15 million
from my share and move on.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.880
-Do you reckon?
-15 million?

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.760
15 million, don’t piss me off.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.520
We go and screw everything. 15 million.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.280
-15 million euros.
-I can sign it on paper if you want.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.360
-For a button?
-For a button.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.280
-Leave him, Berlin.
-What’s going on here?

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.960
Nothing is going on.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.760
It’s funny.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.360
I came here... with the idea

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.040
of shooting you like, I don’t know,
in his feet to compensate

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.200
and I’m beginning to feel like
shooting him in the head

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.720
and I don’t quite know why.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.800
Berlin.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.200
Yes... Shush.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.640
Thank you.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.200
Retroxil, it’s a rare medicine,
made to order.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.720
It’s used to palliate trembling

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.560
caused by a very unusual
degenerative neuronal disease.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.320
What?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.640
Helmers’ Myopathy.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.200
The Russians launched this medicine
four years ago

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.520
and apparently it was successful.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.720
They were able to change
the outcome of Fonollosa's disease

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.160
from being a lethal disease
for all those who suffer it

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.880
to only nine out of ten dying.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.920
So if... Mr Fonollosa is not that one,

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.720
he’ll be dead in less than 24 months.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.000
That man has nothing to lose.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.920
But it’s not necessary...

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.680
Denver.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.680
Denver, is it you?

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.920
I ordered you to kill her on Friday.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.520
And today is Sunday.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.760
Resurrection Sunday!

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.200
Praise the Lord.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.720
Sorry, I’ll let you finish in peace.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.120
It won’t be me who disturbs your privacy.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.280
I'm making you a confession, Denver.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.280
When I saw her there lying on the floor,
dead,

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.280
something inside me was not right.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.480
Sometimes I rush into things.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.400
This temper of mine.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.000
However, it’s clear
that this situation is still uncomfortable

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.720
and we’ll have to do something about it,
but, what?

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.720
On one side of the scales,
Denver, there are the bad things.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.680
You disobeyed me.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.200
I asked you to kill her,

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.960
because that woman
had compromised our plan.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.080
Our plan. And you spared her.
And let’s not talk about the button,

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.040
that, due to your ineptitude,
has put my face in TV news,

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.800
airports, police stations...

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.440
And now for sure, you have definitely
spoiled any chance of future for me.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.160
And on the other side
of the scales, it’s...

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.600
the fact that woman is alive.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.720
And I wonder: What side
of the scales do you think weighs more?

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.440
Don’t be a motherfucker, Berlin,
this isn’t a film by Tarantino, eh?

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.760
Put the gun down.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.680
Put the gun down.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.880
Nairobi, you put the gun down.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.320
-What?
-You put your gun down.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.600
Let’s work this out, put the gun down.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.040
Put the gun down.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.560
Whose head are you going
to blow now, eh, freak?

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.920
Let’s all calm down and put the guns down.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.640
Berlin, Denver, everyone, you, too.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.880
Tell your cousin, come on.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.240
I’m tired of your orders
and your fucking speeches.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.520
Shall I tell you what side of the scales
weighs mores, shall I tell you?

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.480
Wait, Denver, calm down.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.080
I’ll tell you, don’t move.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.040
-Careful.
-No, listen to me.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.480
You know what weighs more?

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.760
Life, surely, Denver.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.320
Yes, it does. So this once, gentlemen,

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.160
let’s put the guns down,

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.960
because there are certain times...

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.320
when life is a miracle

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.400
that it’s good celebrating.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.720
What are you doing?

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.600
-For fuck’s sake, is she alive?
-She’s alive, Tokyo.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.600
Look at her, Denver.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.280
Like those flowers that grow
in the cracked pavement.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.680
That’s it.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.360
-That’s it, yes.
-That’s it.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.280
That’s it.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.520
Berlin, I’m sorry to interrupt you,
but you have to come up,

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.760
the Professor is on the phone.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.800
-"Are you there?"
-Where were you?

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.000
"Let’s say in a sort of..."

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.280
spiritual trip.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.280
And I have returned as a new man.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.320
I’m glad.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.360
Because there’s something important
you need to know.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.800
I put the button

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.440
"of your jacket in the Seat Ibiza.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.160
You killed a hostage,
you stepped over the red line,

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.760
so this is your punishment."

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.560
It hurts to hear that, it hurts terribly.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.840
And, honestly, I believe
it’s a very unfair measure.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.800
You see, I want you
to listen to something.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.680
What’s your name?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.640
My name is Mónica Gaztambide.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.680
-"And how are you?
-Fine."

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.400
-And you’re alive.
-I’m alive.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.240
And she’s very pretty. Thank you.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.280
"Do you understand now
why I think you are unfair?

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.320
You punish me for something
that still hasn’t happened."

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.640
I admire your cynicism.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.440
"But I understand that if that woman
is still alive, it's not thanks to you."

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.640
Unfortunately there’s no turning back.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.320
"The good news
for everyone is that thanks"

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.560
to that happy outcome
we can proceed to plan Valencia.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.440
Gentlemen, plan Valencia is in action.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.360
Now.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.200
Fire!

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.600
What’s that?

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.120
Burst from an M-16.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.280
Several guns firing all at once.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.320
Turn up the reception,
There’s people screaming.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:48.280
And... scream! Louder!
With pain! With passion!

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.120
Louder!

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.720
I spoke to the scientific lab
and ballistics.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.920
I sent out the recordings
and they say they have

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.240
-at least three M-16.
-How many bullets?

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.040
150 approximately, five or six magazines.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.200
It’s a massacre.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.120
It’s not an execution, it’s an affray.
Put me through the Fábrica.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.160
"What the fuck is happening in there,
what have you done?"

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.720
-Aren’t you going to say good evening?
-"Good evening?

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.160
After you leaked our conversations
to the media,

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.040
after you left me in a really bad position
before the public opinion

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.160
and after hearing
that shooting inside there.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.960
-What sort of insane person are you?"
-Inspector, the truth is...

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.960
I don’t recognize you.
You’re an intelligent woman.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.520
We have carried out this negotiation
with mutual respect,

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.760
both professionally and personally.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.200
I’d dare to say that even
with some affection from my side.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.600
So I’ll hang the phone up
and we’ll start again.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.720
"What the...?"

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.760
Phone.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.120
Good evening, Professor.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.640
Good evening.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.560
"You see... I was here..."

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.720
thinking about things and...

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.720
all of the sudden it crossed my mind:

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.800
what kind of music will this man

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.600
"listen to when he has a shower
in the morning?"

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.000
Well, it’ll sound strange to you, but...

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.960
what give the most energy...

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.800
is a Greek Syrtaki dance.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.360
"I don’t know,
it makes me be in a good mood."

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.120
How curious, isn’t it?
Are you of Greek ancestry?

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.240
No, no, the truth is I’m not.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.120
But I don’t know,
I love the films Anthony Quinn is in.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.800
"It’s lively music, actually."

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.400
Not so much as the shots
we heard inside there.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.760
"No, of course not."

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.320
Could you tell me what exactly was that?

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.800
Sure, I would be delighted to.
You see, we have been testing

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.160
some guns we thought that had got wet,

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.960
but they work just fine.
Thank you for asking.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.240
You’re welcome.
It’s a very plausible explanation,

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.720
but there’s another possibility.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.360
"That all went wrong and you had"

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.040
to open fire and shoot the hostages.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.560
Yes, that would be another possibility.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.400
I guess it’s up to you
to be more or less optimistic.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.000
So you won’t mind If I ask you something.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.440
"Inspector...,"

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.080
I’m truly sorry,

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.200
-but I’m a terrible dancer.
-Excuse me?

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.880
"The Syrtaki... If you’re asking
me to dance with you,

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.640
I’m very sorry, but it won’t be possible."

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.440
"No, it’s not that."

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.360
Look.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.480
I want a proof of life of each hostage,

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.440
"recorded today,"

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.720
in front of a television set broadcasting
live. And it’s not negotiable.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.320
I wouldn’t dare haggle
over something so delicate, inspector.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.360
You have an hour to send them over.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.480
-"Hello."
-Prepare the proofs of life.
