WEBVTT

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.760
Stop or I’ll shoot!

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.720
No!

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.400
"My name’s Tokyo.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.800
But when this story started,
that wasn’t my name.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.600
This was me.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.920
SUSPECT'S WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.520
And this, the love of my life.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.560
ROBBER GETS SHOT DEAD

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.680
The last time I saw him
I left him in a pool of blood

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.880
with his eyes open.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.160
We did 15 clean robberies,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.400
but mixing love and work never works.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.440
So, when the security guard shot,
I had to change my job.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.000
From robber to murderer.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.520
And that’s how I started to run away.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.920
Somehow, I was dead too.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.960
Or almost dead.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.600
I had been hidden for 11 days

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.080
and my photo wallpapered
police stations all over Spain.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.640
I’d get a 30 years’ sentence.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.160
And I’m really not the type of girl
who likes getting old

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.400
in the cell of a prison.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.360
I prefer running away.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.480
Body and soul.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.080
And if I can’t take my body there,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.040
at least let my soul escape."

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.680
"I had no time left and there were
important things I had to do.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.400
Just one, really."

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.160
Hello?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.200
"Mum?"

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.680
Oh, my girl.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.600
"How are you, sweetheart?"

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.640
What’s happening?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.360
"Haven’t you seen the news?"

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.760
All those things they say about me.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.200
Yes, of course I’ve seen them.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.840
You know what?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.640
I’m thinking about going on a journey.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.480
"I may join a Chinese ship.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.840
As a cook.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.280
Didn’t you say
I couldn’t even make an omelette?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.800
So I’ll learn. What do you think?"

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.000
I don’t know, sweetheart.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.080
What if they only eat Chinese food?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.720
What does that journey mean,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.080
"that I won’t see you again?"

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.120
Don’t talk nonsense.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.760
Of course you’ll see me.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.960
"I’ll buy you a ticket
so you come to visit me."

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.480
Visit you where?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960
At the cemetery?

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.520
Are you alone?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.000
"Mum, are you alone?"

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.400
Yes.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.440
"Then go to the street,
as if you went to the market.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.880
I’ll find you."

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.880
"And that day,
the day I was going to the slaughterhouse,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.080
my guardian angel appeared.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.200
But you never know for certain
what a guardian angel looks like,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.600
and you’d never imagine
he’d appear in a Seat Ibiza

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.120
of 1992."

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.960
Excuse me, have you got a minute?

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.800
No.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.240
Cooking in a Chinese ship
only has one advantage,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.200
you don’t have to do the washing-up.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.280
"For a moment I thought about the Chinese

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.720
and that I hate people who spit."

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.840
-Who are you, a policeman?
-Wait, wait.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.760
You’re going to the slaughterhouse,
there’s a squad waiting for you

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.480
and they have a car since six days ago...

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800
Why would I believe you?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.520
"And that’s how I met the Professor,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.200
pointing a gun to his balls."

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.120
May I?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.920
"The good thing about relationships

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.240
is that you finally forget
how they started."

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.480
May I?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.240
They’re already in your mother’s house.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.960
That’s why I came to help you.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.600
I want to propose you some business,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.160
a robbery, a robbery that’s...

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.120
singular.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.360
I’m looking for people who...

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400
Well, people who don’t have much to lose.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.680
What do you think about...

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.440
2,400 million euros?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.240
"Nobody had done a job like that,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.360
neither in New York,
nor in London, nor in Monte Carlo.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.600
So if my picture was again in the papers,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.320
at least it’d be due
to the biggest robbery ever."

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.040
WELCOME

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.080
I welcome you

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.080
and... I thank you
for having accepted this...

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.160
this job offer.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.920
We’ll live here,
far from the worldly noise.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.160
Five months, the five months
we’ll spend studying

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.840
-how to do the job.
-What do you mean, five months?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.480
Are we crazy?

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.080
Look, people spend years studying

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.960
to earn a salary,
a salary which, in the best of cases,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.840
is just a salary, a shitty salary.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.480
What are five months?

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.040
I’ve been thinking about this...

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.480
for much longer.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.240
Not to have to work ever again.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.760
Neither you

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.080
nor your children.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.840
Okay.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.880
You don’t know each other yet
and I want it go on like that.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.920
I don’t want any names,
or personal questions,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.080
or, of course, personal relationships.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.840
I want each of you to choose a name,
something simple.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.720
It can be numbers, planets, cities...

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.440
-Like "Mister 17, miss 23."
-That’s a wrong start. I can’t

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.280
-remember my telephone number.
-That’s why I said that.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.640
-And planets?
-I can be Mars, and he Uranus.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.760
I won’t be Uranus, so forget it.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.560
-What’s the matter with Uranus?
-I don’t like the rhyme.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.800
-It’ll be cities. Cities.
-So cities it is.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.400
Okay.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.720
"That’s why I ended up being Tokyo.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.040
The one looking at my arse is Mr Berlin.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.480
Under arrest warrant.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.000
27 robberies.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.480
Jewelleries, auction houses
and security vans.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.880
His biggest job,
the Champs Elysees, in Paris.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.320
434 diamonds.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.680
He’s like a shark in a swimming pool.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.320
You can swim with him,
but you’re never calm.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.280
And he was the boss
in charge of the assault."

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.200
"The one who coughs is Mr Moscow.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.440
The first thing he dug was a mine,
in Asturias.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.640
MOSCOW

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.800
Then he understood
that digging upwards he’d go further.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.120
Six fur shops, three clock shops
and the Caja Rural in Avilés.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.720
He uses the thermal lance
and any industrial equipment.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.960
The one sitting
behind Moscow is Denver, his son.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.760
Drugs, teeth, broken ribs.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.280
He’s the king of fights in discos.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.760
Pure hot blood.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.440
In a perfect plan, a time bomb.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.440
Rio. He’s my weakness.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.520
He’s like Mozart, but with computers.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.520
He programmes since he was six and knows
everything about alarms and electronics.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.240
For the rest of things in life
it’s as if he had been born yesterday.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.960
And those are the Siamese twins,
Helsinki and Oslo.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.800
Even the most sophisticated plan
needs soldiers

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.400
and who better than two Serbs.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.560
Maybe they think,
but, frankly, we’ll never know.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.000
Nairobi,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.080
a hardened optimist.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.800
She has forged banknotes since she was 13.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.800
And now she’s our quality manager.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.080
She might be crazy,
but she’s really funny."

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.640
Think that every day
they’ll talk about us in the news,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.000
every family in the country
will be wondering

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.880
what we’re doing.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.920
And you know what they’ll think?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.600
They’ll think: "Bastards!
I wish I had come up with that idea."

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.840
"The Professor,
no criminal record, no register.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.120
The last time he renewed his ID he was 19.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.680
To all intents, a ghost,
but a very smart ghost."

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.520
We’re not stealing... anybody’s money,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.200
because they’ll even think we’re nice.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.520
And that is vital.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.640
It’s vital we have the public opinion
on our side.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.520
We’re going to be the fucking heroes
of all those people.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.640
But very careful,
because the moment there is

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.040
a single drop of blood,
this is very important,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.320
if there’s a single victim,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.240
we’ll stop being Robin Hoods
and we’ll simply become sons of a bitch.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.440
Professor.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.520
Miss Tokyo.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.480
What are we robbing?

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.000
The Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.920
DAY OF THE ROBBERY
FRIDAY 8:35 A.M.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.040
Who chose the mask?

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.600
-What’s up with the mask?
-It’s not scary.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.560
In bank robbery films the masks are scary.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.240
They’re zombies, skeletons,
the death, I don’t know, you feel...

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.000
With a gun in your hand

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.120
I assure you a madman
is scarier than a skeleton.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.360
-Stop it.
-Who was this guy with the moustache?

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.840
Dalí, son, a Spanish painter.
He was very good.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.920
-A painter.
-Yes.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.720
-A painter of paintings.
-Yes.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.040
Do you know what’s fucking scary?
Dolls for children.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.720
They’re really scary.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.680
What dolls?

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.880
Goofy, Pluto, Mickey Mouse, all those.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.560
A mouse with ears is scarier,
that’s what you’re saying?

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.600
Yes, arsehole.
Do you want me to wallop you?

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.720
-Hey!
-I’m right. Listen to me.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
If a guy at gunpoint
and wearing a Mickey Mouse mask

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.360
gets in a place,
the people will think he’s nuts,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.360
there’s going to be a massacre.
Do you know why?

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.760
Because guns and children

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.760
are two things
you never put together, daddy.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.920
-Am I right or not?
-That way it’d be more dangerous,

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.920
more twisted.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.080
So a Jesus Christ mask
would frighten more, he’s more innocent.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.800
They say "It doesn’t suit you,
it’s like Christ with two guns."

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.320
-"Like a saint with two guns."
-It doesn’t matter.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.920
"It was obvious
there was a lack of women in the gang."

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.520
"A woman can spend two days
choosing shoes for a wedding,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.560
but she’d never use a single minute
to choose masks for a robbery.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.360
Everything we had planned was starting now

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.080
and during those fractions of a second
I thought about all the innocent people

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.520
whose lives we would stop
in their tracks."

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.600
E-80 LOCAL ROAD

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.760
"The Professor knew
there was just one way to come

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.960
in the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre
with three tonnes

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.800
of explosive devices.
It had to be done in the lorry

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.720
that entered the building every week

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.440
with the new paper money rolls
ready to be printed.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.520
And that was what we were going to do,

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.000
getting to the very core,
escorted by the National Police.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.280
In Spain, anything guarded
by two police cars

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.520
is something heavily protected."

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.960
"But if you inhibit any possibility

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.440
for their communication
through the radio or telephone

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.400
and if you point two 26-year-old kids
with five assault rifles at their heads,

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.120
it doesn’t matter if they have guns,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.360
and they feel just like it’d happen
to any of us."

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.200
I said get out of the fucking car!

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.600
-"They’re scared shitless."
-You’ll do as I say!

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.760
"Courage and heroism have a price,

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.800
and it’s greater
than the 1,600 euros a month

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.800
-a kid with a uniform gets..."
-Open the lorry, do you hear me?

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.160
"...or a lorry driver."

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.360
Come on, damn it, open!

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.760
"If those men had had their daughter
on the back of the lorry,

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.240
they’d never have opened it,
but who cares about

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.200
some paper money rolls with a watermark?"

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.640
Hurry up, hurry up!

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.280
Jeez, man! Come on!

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.360
Come on, come on!

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.880
Sit down. Now calm down, the three of you,
otherwise, a blow with the rifle.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.480
You’ll drive with a gun in your kidneys.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.080
When you get the radio call
to know if everything’s all right,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.200
you’ll answer coolly,
as if everything ran smoothly.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.840
Am I clear?

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.360
"And in the middle of that chaos with guns

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.280
I remembered the night before
I had been asked for my hand in marriage

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.800
and that I’d have preferred other plans.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.680
But if you think about it,
you never find a good day for a robbery."

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.960
Now you know what you have to do.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.160
Don’t take your eyes off the girl.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.120
There can’t be any mistakes, all right?

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.760
She’s 17.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.320
I think I can handle her.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.800
Can I sit by your side?

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.800
Sure.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.320
Hello.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.840
Hello.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.960
Do you want to go out with me?

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.480
Okay. I’m leaving.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.160
No, no.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.120
I don’t have to think about it.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.480
I mean, yes.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.080
"Okay, children, we’ve arrived.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.960
Let’s go straight
to the museum’s hall, where...

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.040
Pedro, please, don’t behave like in class.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.000
Let’s go out in an orderly way,
using both doors..."

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.080
And this is the façade
of the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.560
The little lamb is coming in.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.040
Perfect.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.800
Berlin, your turn.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.360
And now, be careful what you do.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.200
How are you, Javi? Where’s Rafita?

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.840
Shift change.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.560
Very well. Keep calm.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.000
Okay, children, get in.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.320
Slowly.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.760
This is important.
As soon as we get the accreditations...

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.840
Keep you accreditations
hanging from your neck.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.480
They must be visible
during the whole visit, okay?

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.400
Don’t turn around.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.120
When you’re next to me,
I can’t even breathe.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.000
Well, breathe,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.280
because in nine months
you will really be out of breath.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.360
Go ahead.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.040
Well visible during the whole visit,
children.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.960
The accreditation in your neck.
Lower your voice.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.480
Berlin, the first camera, on your left.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.000
Aren’t you going to say anything?

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.960
I tell you I’m pregnant,
and you just keep calm?

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.000
What shall I do, call my wife,
tell her to pick up the children

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.200
and we all go to celebrate?
For God’s sake!

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.680
Go on, go on. Come on.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.800
ACCESS TO SECURITY SYSTEM

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.120
Coming in.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.520
Be alert, Tokyo.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.520
ACCESS TO ALARM SYSTEM

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.800
Great!

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.200
-"Alarms disengaged."
-Now.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.560
Go ahead, come on.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.680
It was you who said yesterday
you’re in a bad situation,

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.360
-you can’t stand her, you have problems.
-Problems just like any couple, Mónica,

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.560
like any other married couple
with three children,

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.080
not that I want to get divorced.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.080
Mónica, I’ve had three children,
all of them with in vitro fertilisation.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.240
I’ve been having sterile intercourses
with my wife for over 20 years

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.440
and now you tell me this.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.680
You must be Shiva,
the goddess of fertility.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.280
What are you insinuating?

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.680
I didn’t come here
looking for a pension, you know?

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.400
Or for a divorce,

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.800
and much less for a paternity test.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.000
I thought you loved me.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.280
And...

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.320
And I think it’s a nice idea.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.120
Hard to make it fit in our lives, but...

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.840
but a wonderful idea.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.320
Listen!

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.640
What? Do you want to know
what I’m going to do with your child?

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.920
-That’s what you want, right?
-Listen to me, don’t rush.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.200
Don’t move!

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.600
Freeze.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.840
Don’t move! Don’t move or I’ll kill you!

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.600
-What’s the matter? Do something!
-Stand up! Stand up!

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.960
Get out!

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.000
"Come on, come on!"

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.360
Hurry up! Don’t move!

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.960
Come on, come on!

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.360
Come on!

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.400
Yes, yes!

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.640
Fuck!

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.480
Come on, come on.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.720
This way. Come on.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.240
And this wonderful staircase,
made of marble and granite...

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.240
Don’t move!

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.240
Don’t move!

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.000
Don’t move! Come on!

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:07.920
Get back!

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.880
-Please, don’t!
-Professor, we have a problem.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.080
I can’t see the little lamb.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.840
I can’t fucking see her!

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.680
Miss Parker, where have you gone?

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.480
Wait.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.720
-Please!
-Let’s go! That way!

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.640
Stop. Stop.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.040
Okay.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.240
Okay, okay.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.400
I’m going too fast. I know.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.280
Let’s immortalize this, right?

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.120
Let’s take a picture with your phone.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:22.880
Wait...

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.040
Jesus...

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.560
Here? It’s a bit seedy, right?

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.320
It’s our first day.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.120
You look so pretty.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.680
I can’t find the girl.
I can’t fucking see her.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.280
Open here. Open and look a bit sexy.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.200
It’s your phone.
If you want, you can erase it.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.400
This is for both of us, for you and me.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.600
Come on, come on.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.680
With this photo
you’ll be all the rage on the Internet.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.600
Give me my phone! I said give it to me!

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.560
Give me my phone! Give it to me!

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.480
Give me the fucking phone!
Give me the phone!

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.600
Give me the phone!

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.160
Give me the phone!

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.000
First of all...

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.000
Good morning.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.640
I’m the person who’s in charge.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.520
And, first of all, I want...

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.920
to offer my apologies.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.080
Truly, this is not the way
to end the week.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.040
Phone.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.800
But you’re here as hostages.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.400
Phone.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.680
If you obey,
I guarantee you’ll be left alive.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.800
-Name.
-Alison Parker.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.640
-PIN.
-2078.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.800
Phone.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.360
Calm down, calm down.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.240
Calm down.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.240
PIN.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.720
Why do you need the PIN?

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.960
Either you tell me the fucking PIN
or I’ll blow you with my rifle butt.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.960
How long are you pregnant for?

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.120
Eight months.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.240
Eight months.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.320
-PIN.
-1234.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.880
You look so smart,

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.480
but you’ve got that shitty PIN.
What an arsehole. Your name.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.720
-Arturo.
-Arturo what?

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.520
-Arturo Román.
-Arturo Román, very well. Arturito.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.560
You’re our safe-conduct here,
so I’m going to protect you.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.040
Hey...

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.240
Give me your hands. Let go.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.600
Let go. Let go.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.720
What’s your name?

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.840
Ariadna.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.200
Ariadna.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.560
Come with me. Come.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.760
Calm down.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.600
Feel my hands.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.360
-Are they the hands of a monster?
-No, no.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.120
Because I’m not a monster.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.800
I know perfectly how you feel.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.040
The dry mouth, the shortness of breath....
You have to try to calm down. Breathe in.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.320
Breathe in.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.760
Breathe in.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.080
That’s it.
Please, breathe with me, all of you.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.560
Breathe in.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.120
Easy, easy.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.400
Make yourself responsible
for your breathing. Breathe out.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.160
Very well. Very well.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.960
Miss Mónica Gaztambide, please?

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.360
Don’t move. Please, don’t move.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.320
-Be quiet.
-I said don’t move.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.360
Be quiet.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.760
Miss Mónica Gaztambide,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.720
would you be so kind as to step forward?

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.080
It’s me.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.840
You’re a star, dad!

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.720
You’re the best!

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.000
You can sleep very well here, dad.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.280
You can sleep grandly here.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.240
Oh! Dad, dad!

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.560
Fucking. Here, boom!

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.880
Boom, boom...

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.840
Come on, stop fooling around
and let’s get to work. Come on, jeez.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.680
This smells fucking great.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.560
It smells better than roast lamb,
dad, that roast lamb.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.640
-Lay down here, jeez.
-Come on, Jesus!

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.320
When have you had such a bed?
You didn’t have it in jail.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.760
Have you seen where we are, dad?
We’re the best.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.640
-We’re the best.
-Boy, don’t get this wrong.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.920
We’re very small.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.360
Can you do anything?

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.400
Have you ever had a job?

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.040
Have you ever left you CV anywhere?

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.200
Ah. Come on, jeez.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.040
My CV.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.240
My CV, what for?

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.720
To take you out of Alcalá-Meco?

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.080
Do you think I feel proud of that?

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.760
12 years of my life
coming in and out of prison.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.720
And you know why?

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.720
Why?

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.360
Because I’m not very smart, son.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.000
And neither are you.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.760
But the brains of this job
is another person.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.800
And if we’re lucky
and you don’t act like an arsehole,

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.920
you’ll leave this place
with your life settled.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.280
-I’m not acting like an arsehole.
-Come on, jeez!

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.080
Fill them.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.920
I want you to answer the phone

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.840
and convince whoever it is
that we are closed

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.520
-due to a technical problem. Understood?
-Yes.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.200
I have no choice
but to point at you with a gun.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.360
-Can you feel it?
-Yes.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.200
Good.

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.840
Now.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.640
Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre, tell me.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.720
No, I’m sorry, I can’t put you
through Arturo right now.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.000
The system is down.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.160
No, I can’t bring him up here.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.000
No, he can’t come here
to pick up the phone.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.200
No, it can’t be.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.800
No, because...

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.080
Just because,
I don’t know where he is right now,

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.840
I don’t know if he’s in the factory,
in the museum, in the canteen

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.400
or wherever he is!
And besides, that’s not my job, miss!

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:34.960
That was a performance worthy of an Oscar,
miss Gaztambide.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.680
"20 minutes after coming in,
we started to wire

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.360
the analogue communication system
to talk to the Professor.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:01.080
Without phones or radio frequency,
with nobody being able to hear us.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.840
We had sealed the doors
and the alarms hadn’t set off.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.160
We were like in a time limbo,
with nobody knowing

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.720
we had taken over
the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.480
And in that sweet peace, before the storm,

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.520
it just seemed

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.200
an ordinary day."

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.640
You look handsome, right?

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.000
Who is it?

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.800
It’s me, let me in.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.440
Rio, man. If the Professor sees us,
he’ll kill us, don’t you know?

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.240
I know, I know.
I have to talk to you. Sit down.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.040
-What’s up?
-Sit down, jeez.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.640
What’s up?

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.240
Tomorrow’s the robbery.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.240
And we have no fucking idea
what is going to happen.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.440
That’s why I want you to know
I’m serious with you

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.840
and I understand perfectly that, well,
that you’re not a child any more and...

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.000
and you may be looking for...
a more serious commitment.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.600
That’s why I want to give you something.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.360
I didn’t buy you a ring
because we’re locked up here,

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.200
but as soon as I go out
I’ll buy you such a big gem

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.080
you’ll need to carry your hand
in a fucking wheelbarrow.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.560
What’s this?

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.680
An engagement badge?

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.720
Now at least you’ll know my real name.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.880
Right, but we’re not allowed
to know each other’s names.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.000
Well, don’t look at it.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.000
But it’s yours.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.320
How should I tell you this?

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.680
Our affair has been very well, okay?
Great.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.880
We have slept together some evenings...

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.200
What do you mean, some?
Jeez, all of them. But four or five...

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.680
Sincerely, I don’t think
we’re the perfect couple.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.520
-Don’t we fuck well?
-Yes, we do fuck well, wonderfully.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.960
That’s a start, right?

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.600
But you need something more
than fucking well to be a couple, right?

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.160
Are you saying that because
I’m 12 years younger than you?

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.160
I’m going to have
300 million euros, right?

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.360
I’m not a child, my life is settled.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.240
-Really, Rio, I wish we had...
-What do you mean with "had"?

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.000
There was love. There was, I was there.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.000
There’s another man, right?

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.440
Not anymore.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.280
Look, Rio,

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.920
when all this is over,
maybe you and I will go to Tahiti

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.440
and see if this works, but tomorrow
I only want to think about one thing:

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:32.960
not to get killed.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.520
Rio.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.680
Rio, don’t.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.640
No, no.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.680
You left a phone on.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.920
Well, turn it off.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.240
The vault is open.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.760
Put on your vests and get ready to go out.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.080
As soon as you’re ready,
we’ll activate the alarm.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.640
Berlin, ready to open the doors.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.720
Hostages, for your security,
all of you three steps back!

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.080
A little more over here. Very well.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.520
Okay. Everything’s going to be all right.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.240
A little closer.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.040
Calm down.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.880
Calm down. I can see the bags.
They’re full of money.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.840
Now they’ll leave and it’ll be all right.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.400
"There’s a 10-33 at the Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.680
Z24 on our way.
We’ll get there in two minutes."

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.720
Two minutes.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.480
Two minutes.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.400
-Why did the alarm go off?
-I don’t know.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.720
They’re just standing there,
I don’t understand.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.800
-Why don’t they take the money and leave?
-I don’t know!

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.200
One minute, 40 seconds.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.440
One minute...

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.120
What’s your name?

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.680
Arturo.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.040
-Arturo, right?
-Yes. No, I haven’t seen anything!

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.560
I haven’t seen anything, I swear,
I haven’t seen anything!

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.800
-Look at me.
-I haven’t seen anything.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.080
Come on, Arturo, look at me.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.560
Look at me, look at me.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.200
Hey, hey, come on.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.680
Hey.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.520
Do you like cinema?

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.120
Do you like it?

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.960
I’m... I’m a big fan.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.080
Have you realised in horror films

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.840
there’s always someone at the beginning,
like this, a nice guy like you,

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.160
and you think: "That guy’s going to die",

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.360
-and then it happens?
-No...

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.960
He always dies.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.440
Arturo, believe me, you’re that guy.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.880
"Z24 to headquarters,
we’ll be there in 30 seconds."

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:38.880
30 seconds.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.680
30 seconds.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.840
"It’s vital that the police"

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.560
don’t have the faintest idea
about what we’re doing.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.600
We’ll make them believe
we came in for a robbery,

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.400
they caught us by surprise leaving with
the money and everything was fucked up,

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.480
we took out the guns, shot point-blank
and we had no choice...

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.920
but to go back.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.960
"And then, not having hurt"

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.160
anybody,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.160
we get inside.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.160
"Let them think we’re trapped like rats.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.240
Let them think we’re improvising."

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.160
Now!

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.800
Tokyo! Tokyo, wait, it’s too soon!

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:25.960
Tokyo!

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.200
"Go out, throw the money,
shot at the ground and go back.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.800
I’d heard that more than 30 times.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.520
But what the Professor didn’t tell us

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.920
is that they would
also shoot point-blank."

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.080
Rio, Rio!

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.160
Holy shit, man!

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.440
Holy shit!

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.400
This couldn’t have started
fucking worse, man!

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.520
Fuck!

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.200
"Urgent support. We need urgent support.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.040
In the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.840
We’ve got hostile gunfire. Officer down.
I repeat, officer down."

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.840
"An M16 bullet is fired at 3,510 kph.

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.320
It flies faster than the speed of sound.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.760
So if you’re shot in the heart,

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.880
you won’t even hear
the bullet that has killed you.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.360
That’s how I knew I had fucked it all up,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.600
in a millisecond

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.360
and the same way as usual."
