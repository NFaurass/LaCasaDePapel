WARNING: THIS DOCUMENTARY
CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM THE FOURTH SEASON

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.792
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL DOCUMENTARY

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:20.083
This series was unexpected from the start.

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:24.417
<i>Money Heist</i> is a story of failure.

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:31.458
Because the series flopped.

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:36.708
"Okay, well, I'll see you around
in other projects." And suddenly...

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:41.208
"Awesome, Netflix has bought it."

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.250
Suddenly, it was being watched abroad,
even more so than in Spain.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.917
That's when it suddenly started
to really take off.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.333
[shouting]

00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:58.208
And you realize
that a tsunami is about to hit.

00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:01.500
The team, we couldn't believe it.

00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:04.625
We realized that people had a bond
with the series

00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:06.583
that went beyond just entertainment.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:10.250
[Pedro Alonso] The impact that it has had
on people around the world

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:14.667
and their expectations of the series
right now puts you to the test.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.292
None of us realized
until we had the chance to get out there.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:22.250
Your life changes completely.
Your reality changes.

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:24.958
Yes, there are changes. [laughs]

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:28.125
-"We have to come back with a bang."
-[siren wailing]

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:31.792
Let them see what we can do, right?
So we brought out the big guns.

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.000
[explosion]

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:33.917
And we did.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.542
[fast-paced music playing]

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:56.667
[gun cocks]

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.000
[narrator speaking Spanish]
<i>Our story begins in 2017,</i>

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:02.500
<i>on a free Spanish TV channel: Antena 3.</i>

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:04.083
You're on TV.

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:08.042
[narrator] <i>We started off well</i>
<i>with 4.5 million viewers.</i>

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:08.958
Good.

00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:10.375
[narrator] <i>But...</i>

00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:13.958
[Jesús Colmenar] The first season 
did very well, especially at the start,

00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:16.875
but viewership gradually declined
in the second season.

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.208
It started to wane.

00:02:18.292 --> 00:02:19.333
It dropped by half.

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:22.417
The audience kept getting smaller.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.958
-[Miguel Herrán] It was plummeting.
-Falling...

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:25.875
And suddenly...

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.042
-It dies.
-...it's over.

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:28.333
It ends... [snaps fingers] and it's over.

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:32.333
And we put the series
in the back of our minds.

00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:34.458
I cried a lot on the last day.

00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:36.292
[sobbing]
I feel as though I've killed her.

00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:39.708
-It was hard.
-I went through a real grieving process.

00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:43.667
I cried over my character.
It was hard to say goodbye.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:45.542
[sniffles]

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:47.083
"It's the end of the road."

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.208
Yeah, it was pretty crazy.

00:02:50.292 --> 00:02:51.167
And it was tough.

00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958
[narrator] <i>And then Netflix comes along</i>

00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:57.875
<i>and buys the Spanish series </i>
<i>so the rest of the world can watch.</i>

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:02.083
Netflix includes it
in its international catalog.

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:03.042
Cool!

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:06.250
It goes to Netflix.
But it's like no big deal.

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:10.292
I don't think we,
Netflix or anyone expected anything.

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.583
In fact, it was launched
without advertising.

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.792
It simply appears in the catalog.

00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:18.458
[laughs] It was part of Netflix's 
basic catalog, and then...

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:21.667
[narrator]
<i>Suddenly, something starts to happen.</i>

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.292
[Jaime Lorente] I hardly had any followers
and then suddenly, I had 15,000.

00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:27.500
Then 30,000, 50,000, 60,000.

00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:30.875
I suddenly had half a million followers,
600,000, 700,000.

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.000
From many countries.

00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:34.625
I'd look and then two hours later,
another 2,000.

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:36.708
We all started getting more followers.

00:03:36.792 --> 00:03:39.875
That's what tipped us off,
"Wow, something's happening here."

00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.500
-[explosion]
-[narrator] <i>A boom, to be precise.</i>

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:45.625
[cheering]

00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:53.375
Enormous banners in Saudi Arabia.
I couldn't believe it.

00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:56.167
In Brazil, in Mexico, in Colombia.

00:03:57.375 --> 00:03:59.042
On the other side of the world.

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:02.000
We started to get photographs
from the carnival in Rio.

00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:03.583
All in <i>Money Heist </i>costumes.

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:06.000
Some crazy guy has a tattoo of Úrsula. 
[laughs]

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:10.000
-Where?
-A full-leg tattoo, in color, this big.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:13.292
"You what? What are you going on about?
I mean, what is this?"

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:15.250
-[chattering]
-[laughing]

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:16.292
[narrator] <i>And it gets better.</i>

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:19.833
<i>We earned a worldwide rank of two,</i>

00:04:19.917 --> 00:04:22.792
<i>competing against every series ever made.</i>

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:26.917
My goodness!
Not even the Americans would do this.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.875
[narrator] <i>Netflix's head honchos</i>
<i>start talking about us in their meetings.</i>

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:33.292
[speaking English] <i>Casa de papel</i>

00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:35.917
or <i>Money Heist </i>as it was released
in the US,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.917
so successful for us
all around the world.

00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:42.833
[narrator] <i>Stephen King,</i>
<i>Benzema and Mbappé put the mask on.</i>

00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:47.000
<i>Neymar too. He liked it so much</i>
<i>that he ended up being a monk.</i>

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:50.000
Oh, heavenly, Mr. Andrés.

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:52.042
I'm a fan.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.458
-[narrator] <i>After that...</i>
-A bit of suspense.

00:04:54.542 --> 00:04:57.667
<i>-...can anything else happen?</i>
<i>-</i>[imitates drum roll]

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.500
[narrator] <i>Yes, we win an Emmy.</i>

00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:00.958
<i>"Money Heist."</i>

00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:04.375
[narrator] <i>And a strange honor:</i>
<i>we start to inspire robberies.</i>

00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:09.000
With red overalls,
the famous Dalí mask and armed.

00:05:09.083 --> 00:05:09.917
[narrator] <i>Several of them.</i>

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.958
A million-dollar gold heist.

00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:14.750
[man] <i>...the characters</i>
<i>from the series </i>Money Heist.

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:17.958
It's been imitated, copied,
using similar masks.

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:22.542
[narrator] <i>But the most exciting thing</i>
<i>occurs in the streets.</i>

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:28.083
<i>The red jumpsuits and the mask are paraded</i>
<i>around America, Europe and Asia.</i>

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.042
<i>They're used in political protest marches</i>

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:34.500
<i>in Lebanon, Iraq, France and Chile.</i>

00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:36.667
<i>And along with the revived "Bella Ciao,"</i>

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.750
<i>it travels the world</i>
<i>for causes such as democracy,</i>

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:42.625
<i>-feminism or the environment.</i>
-[all] Now!

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:43.958
[singing in Spanish]

00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:47.458
[singing in foreign languages]

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:53.458
[singing continuing]

00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:56.458
[chanting]

00:05:56.542 --> 00:05:57.625
AUGUST 2019

00:05:57.708 --> 00:06:02.875
[Álvaro Morte] But when an NGO rescues
a boat full of immigrants

00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958
and as soon as they are brought to safety,
they start to sing "Bella Ciao"...

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:13.750
That's much more important
than any of the rest.

00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:18.333
[narrator] <i>Then Netflix asks us,</i>
<i>"Guys, can you carry out another robbery?"</i>

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:19.708
What?

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.333
[laughs] Wow, wait a second.

00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:25.625
I think we took two months to reply

00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:27.208
because we wanted something...

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.667
with the maximum guarantee
of not letting viewers down,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.583
something that wouldn't disappoint
all those people.

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.000
We have to get the gang together.

00:06:39.042 --> 00:06:40.792
"I can't believe it, how cool!"

00:06:40.875 --> 00:06:42.500
We're the Resistance, right?

00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:45.875
[narrator] <i>When we started filming again,</i>
<i>we realized for the first time</i>

00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.750
<i>how much our lives had changed.</i>

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:49.750
<i>This was fame.</i>

00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:55.042
[Alonso] When we got to Duomo Square,
which was our first location,

00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:57.000
it was already full of people.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.917
We can see all of that.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.917
[laughs]
"What's going on? We have to film here?"

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:10.667
[man] They surrounded us
as if it were a soccer stadium.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.625
[Morte] They stayed deathly silent,
which was wonderful.

00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:16.833
[man speaks Italian]

00:07:16.917 --> 00:07:20.167
[Alonso speaking Spanish]
I said to myself, "Okay, concentrate.

00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:23.542
No eye contact until you finish."

00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:29.458
When we were coming to the end
of the sequence,

00:07:29.542 --> 00:07:33.125
I said to Álvaro, "Hey, Álvaro,
let's go say hi to everyone."

00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:35.667
Shall we quickly say hi to everyone?

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:40.250
And we took three or four steps,

00:07:40.917 --> 00:07:46.333
and as we approached them, suddenly,
they were coming from all sides...

00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:47.875
[imitates clamoring crowd]

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:54.125
<i>Grazie mille.</i> We must get back.

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:56.083
We weren't able to finish filming.

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:59.500
[narrator] 
<i>We had to stop filming. A catastrophe.</i>

00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:01.708
<i>We ended up hiding out in a building.</i>

00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:04.167
<i>There was no way we could continue.</i>

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.167
Not from any angle,
the reflection in the window...

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.750
It's packed. There are 4,000 people
in the square right now.

00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:13.708
-Seriously, we're laughing, but...
-Jesús!

00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:15.292
But it's a nightmare.

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:16.667
We can't film.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.125
[Alonso] But we still find it funny.

00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:21.042
[laughs] This is going to turn tragic.

00:08:21.708 --> 00:08:24.083
[narrator] <i>And it did.</i>
<i>It was difficult getting to the car.</i>

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:26.750
<i>People started running after us.</i>

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:27.708
[laughing]

00:08:27.792 --> 00:08:29.875
If I get out, there will be a scene.
Watch out!

00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:30.792
[laughing]

00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:32.333
We were like The Beatles. [laughs]

00:08:32.708 --> 00:08:35.833
[narrator] <i>And at the next location,</i>
<i>which should have been peaceful...</i>

00:08:36.292 --> 00:08:38.250
I don't like to have to tell you this.

00:08:39.375 --> 00:08:40.875
[narrator] 
<i>...the biggest thing was waiting.</i>

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.667
[singing "Bella Ciao"]

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:46.042
[man] Cut!

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:49.208
[Alonso] I think there was a point
when we'd gone in there,

00:08:49.292 --> 00:08:51.417
we saved it, we made the sequence work.

00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:52.625
And Álvaro said...

00:08:52.708 --> 00:08:56.875
"Pedro, maybe it'd be cool
to say thanks to these people." [laughs]

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.500
I said, "Álvaro, no. [laughs]

00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:01.208
Look what happened at the Duomo,
we could die."

00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:02.667
I'm fucking with you.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.917
[Morte] And we had the idea
of standing on a bench.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.167
[crowd applauding, cheering]

00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:12.250
And someone jumped over the barrier.
[laughs]

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:15.083
[speaking English] 
Thank you so much for your support.

00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:17.375
Wow! Oh, no!

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:21.875
-[clamoring]
-[shouting]

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:24.625
[speaking Spanish]
We started to see people running

00:09:24.708 --> 00:09:27.083
like there was no tomorrow.

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:30.792
[speaking English] We just want 
to thank you, all of you, for being here.

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:33.583
-Thank you so much.
-[cheering]

00:09:41.333 --> 00:09:44.083
[Morte] All of a sudden,
my face is all over the world.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.458
This is insane.

00:09:45.542 --> 00:09:49.750
It's very worrying
because you stop being anonymous.

00:09:50.792 --> 00:09:51.917
It's extraordinary.

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:55.125
[Alonso] 
It would take its toll on all of us.

00:09:56.042 --> 00:10:00.042
[Herrán] Cars with tinted windows, 
escorted by bodyguards when abroad.

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:05.500
It has suddenly taken on
a much, much wider dimension.

00:10:05.583 --> 00:10:11.583
Everyone who sees you on the street says,
"You're awesome."

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.708
Then you get home and some people say,
"I am awesome."

00:10:15.792 --> 00:10:17.542
I went from being totally anonymous

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:21.083
to suddenly having to ask
to be allowed in the VIP lounge

00:10:21.375 --> 00:10:26.250
because people wouldn't stop asking
for photos with me. No.

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:30.125
Unless you really keep yourself in check,
you become an asshole.

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:32.792
A real asshole.

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:38.208

This is a worldwide phenomenon.

The nicest thing about it is that it came
from the viewers.

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:18.792
This was on another level.

00:11:18.875 --> 00:11:21.417
It came about spontaneously.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.875
I think there's a kind of "love attack."

00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.042
We realized that people had a connection
with the series

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:30.000
that went beyond pure entertainment.

00:11:30.083 --> 00:11:32.542
It was almost a philosophical connection.

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.250
It's a bit overwhelming.

00:11:34.333 --> 00:11:37.083
It's hard to believe,
but that's how it is.

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:39.625
It was reaffirming for us, like,

00:11:39.708 --> 00:11:42.375
"We weren't crazy,
we were doing something cool."

00:11:42.458 --> 00:11:45.208
[narrator] <i>The craziness begins</i>

00:11:46.917 --> 00:11:48.542

00:11:52.417 --> 00:11:54.708
[Lorente] 
I remember there was less money before,

00:11:54.792 --> 00:11:56.625
but there was the same energy.

00:11:56.708 --> 00:11:58.292
From the very start,

00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:02.375
our idea was to make
an international series.

00:12:02.458 --> 00:12:05.250
We went all out.
Everyone was crazy about it.

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:08.458

"This is the time to do it.

Let's do something..."

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.875
It was very ambitious.

The damn fan is jammed, man.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.542
The bills only fall on one side.

00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:34.042
It's the wind. We can't control it.

00:13:34.125 --> 00:13:35.583
The fan isn't spinning.

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:38.250
It was sheer despair. Just imagine Jesús,

You should come up with some, too.

Other than not filming,
canceling the shoot and going home.

00:16:12.708 --> 00:16:13.875
Some kind of solution.

This has been building up.

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:17.542

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.708
You don't connect
with a spectacular robbery,

00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:48.083
nor with the Professor's intelligence,
even if you admire it,

00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:50.375
you connect
with the fact that he's scared.

00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:52.333
Even if all this works out, I...

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:55.083
I'm going to be screwed.

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:58.125
When you get hooked on
or addicted to a series,

00:18:58.208 --> 00:18:59.750
you get addicted to the characters.

00:18:59.833 --> 00:19:03.125
After a marathon session,
you think, "I know these people.

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:05.375
They're in my living room with me."

00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:09.458
[Álex Pina] So, if the characters are
emotionally more powerful and richer,

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.833
the viewer definitely becomes
more addicted.

00:19:12.917 --> 00:19:15.792
[narrator] <i>And how do you achieve that?</i>
<i>The first key:</i>

00:19:15.875 --> 00:19:17.542
What we are, Latinos or Germans?

00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:18.958
[narrator] <i>We're Latinos.</i>

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:21.000
<i>There's passion here.</i>

00:19:21.125 --> 00:19:22.667
WE HAVE PASSION

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.792
The thing that sets the series apart
is that it has heart.

00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:34.500
[inhales] For a long time,
there was a unwritten rule

00:19:34.583 --> 00:19:38.792
that action films were inane
and superficial

00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:43.250
and very dramatic or emotional films
were boring.

00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:45.958
So what we did was mix those two concepts.

00:19:46.042 --> 00:19:47.250
[shouts]

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:48.625
[sobs]

00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:49.833
-I love you!
-Me too!

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.583
[narrator] <i>That's why our heist story</i>
<i>is very romantic.</i>

00:19:57.917 --> 00:20:01.792
This is a love story.
One of those beautiful love stories.

00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:04.125
[narrator] <i>And we obsess about that.</i>

00:20:04.208 --> 00:20:08.208
<i>No matter what it takes,</i>
<i>we want unbridled passion.</i>

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:12.042
<i>Like with this kiss. Candid, right?</i>

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.042
<i>Well, it took some time to get it right.</i>

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:19.542
<i>Maybe the director looking on,</i>
<i>just inches from their lips, didn't help.</i>

00:20:21.083 --> 00:20:22.583
You want us to make out.

00:20:23.792 --> 00:20:25.333
-A little bit.
-Yeah.

00:20:25.417 --> 00:20:26.875
[narrator] <i>They try again.</i>

00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:30.958
<i>But it still isn't working.</i>

00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:33.875
That kiss was kind of...

00:20:36.833 --> 00:20:39.292
It matched the scene, kind of maternal.

00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:42.417
But it has to be passionate.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.208
-The last kiss you ever share.
-Okay.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.417
-Understand?
-Yes.

00:20:47.208 --> 00:20:48.875
[narrator] <i>And they try.</i>

00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:53.125
<i>But it's no use.</i>

00:20:53.667 --> 00:20:57.125
It's really hard because,
on the one hand, I'm trying to...

00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:59.958
be like...

00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:02.458
-the mother.
-Sure.

00:21:02.542 --> 00:21:06.292
-You have to keep acting like heroes.
-Okay.

00:21:06.375 --> 00:21:07.958
But it's the goodbye kiss.

00:21:08.042 --> 00:21:12.083
[narrator] <i>But when it comes to passion,</i>
<i>if you put affection and effort into it...</i>

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:14.042
-Stop filming.
-<i>...it happens.</i>

00:21:15.083 --> 00:21:18.208
<i>♪ I love you ♪</i>

00:21:18.792 --> 00:21:21.583
<i>♪ You love me... ♪</i>

00:21:22.208 --> 00:21:23.292
Cut!

00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:26.500
[narrator] <i>There's another important</i>
<i>factor in this series:</i>

00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:28.750
<i>keeping the viewer on edge.</i>

00:21:28.833 --> 00:21:30.958
The fun is in here, for fuck's sake.

00:21:31.042 --> 00:21:33.083
[narrator] <i>Anything can happen here.</i>

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:36.333
<i>We try to be unpredictable.</i>

00:21:36.417 --> 00:21:38.750
WE ARE UNPREDICTABLE

00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:41.125
<i>We try to do the unexpected,</i>

00:21:41.208 --> 00:21:44.083
<i>and it's been that way</i>
<i>since we came up with these guys:</i>

00:21:44.167 --> 00:21:45.250
<i>-the characters.</i>
-[laughing]

00:21:45.708 --> 00:21:48.125
<i>We wanted profiles</i>
<i>that haven't been seen before.</i>

00:21:48.208 --> 00:21:49.750
<i>For example: our leader.</i>

00:21:49.833 --> 00:21:51.333
Oh, the Professor!

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.458
-[narrator] <i>Very clever, yes.</i>
-What an amazing man.

00:21:55.083 --> 00:21:57.458
[narrator] <i>Leader of a criminal gang, yes.</i>

00:21:57.542 --> 00:22:00.500
<i>But deep down, he's a loser.</i>

00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:10.333
<i>It's that personality that makes him</i>
<i>talk differently to other robbers we know.</i>

00:22:10.417 --> 00:22:11.250
<i>It surprises us.</i>

00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:12.292
What are you wearing?

00:22:12.375 --> 00:22:14.542
[Pina] Our professor, the gang leader,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.250
was shaped to be almost like a nerd.

00:22:18.333 --> 00:22:20.250
He wants to be distanced from society.

00:22:20.333 --> 00:22:22.208
[Pina] He's a sociopath in many ways,

00:22:22.292 --> 00:22:25.792
a shy man with problems interacting
with some women.

00:22:25.875 --> 00:22:27.792
I've had relationships.

00:22:29.583 --> 00:22:30.417
Several.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.875
Turning those characters around

00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:34.875
is stimulating for the viewers,

00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:36.375
because it's so surprising.

00:22:36.458 --> 00:22:38.042
That such an ordinary person...

00:22:38.125 --> 00:22:41.208
Well,
let's see if I'm of some use at least.

00:22:41.292 --> 00:22:43.417
...could create something so big.

00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:47.292
We must be able to stay in control.

00:22:47.708 --> 00:22:51.042
The more difficult it is to shape
the character to do that,

00:22:51.125 --> 00:22:52.375
the more stimulating it is.

00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:57.667
[narrator] <i>There is one character</i>

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.292
<i>who encapsulates</i>
<i>all our ability to be unexpected. </i>

00:23:01.417 --> 00:23:03.875
I really feel like telling you everything.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:08.292
[narrator] <i>Tokyo is able </i>
<i>to blow up any kind of situation.</i>

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.708
<i>She's our Sputnik, fuel for any script.</i>

00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:14.583
[Tokyo] 
<i>I can be a good girl for a long time,</i>

00:23:15.542 --> 00:23:19.458
<i>but little by little,</i>
<i>my naughty side starts to come out.</i>

00:23:19.958 --> 00:23:22.333
Combining regular places
with unexpected twists,

00:23:22.417 --> 00:23:26.500
is a formula that, nowadays,

00:23:26.583 --> 00:23:27.583
works really well.

00:23:27.667 --> 00:23:29.875
[laughs] Tokyo, Tokyo.

00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:33.250
So mature for some things,
yet so childish for others.

00:23:33.333 --> 00:23:35.083
She's a very impulsive person.

00:23:35.167 --> 00:23:37.083
Didn't you say "no matter what"?

00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:43.792
She tries to control herself,
but it's beyond her nature.

00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:46.542
I'm not surprised he dumped me.<i> </i>[sobs]

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:48.542
[narrator] 
<i>Here's a fact you don't know about Tokyo.</i>

00:23:48.625 --> 00:23:50.833
-I'm Tokyo.
-[narrator] <i>She was the first city.</i>

00:23:50.917 --> 00:23:52.583
That wasn't my name at the start.

00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:55.750
Why is Tokyo called Tokyo?
I was going to tell her.

00:23:56.042 --> 00:23:57.333
She doesn't know.

00:23:57.417 --> 00:23:59.542
I was really surprised...

00:24:00.667 --> 00:24:02.917
when I saw
that my character's name was Tokyo.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.750
I remember Álex Pina was wearing a T-shirt

00:24:06.292 --> 00:24:07.583
that said "Tokyo" on it.

00:24:07.667 --> 00:24:08.583
I loved it.

00:24:08.667 --> 00:24:11.875
"It's a great name. The main character
has to be called Tokyo."

00:24:11.958 --> 00:24:13.833
<i>That's how I ended up being called Tokyo.</i>

00:24:13.917 --> 00:24:17.083
Within 15 minutes, I said,
"Berlin, Moscow, Denver."

00:24:17.167 --> 00:24:19.083
-Denver?
-It was really quick.

00:24:19.167 --> 00:24:20.125
Tokyo, Berlin, Moscow.

00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:22.875
Denver, Moscow. What's this?
Why are we called that?

00:24:22.958 --> 00:24:25.875
I think my friends
with cities for names kick ass.

00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:28.500
-[crying]
-[narrator] <i>We are emotional.</i>

00:24:28.583 --> 00:24:29.875
[sobbing]

00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:32.333
[narrator] 
<i>Which brings us to the next key:</i>

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.208
<i>this series is full of empathy.</i>

00:24:35.292 --> 00:24:36.500
EMPATHY

00:24:36.583 --> 00:24:39.500
<i>So much so</i>
<i>that we have grown to love the bad guy.</i>

00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:41.667
Why did he put you in charge?

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.667
Because of my people skills.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.667
Berlin was the most hostile character.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.708
But he was also mysterious at the start,
"Who is this man?"

00:24:51.208 --> 00:24:52.583
[narrator] <i>A special man.</i>

00:24:52.792 --> 00:24:55.250
If I have a coffee right now,
I'll go crazy.

00:24:55.333 --> 00:24:57.208
[narrator] <i>Despicable most of the time...</i>

00:24:57.625 --> 00:24:58.458
Dance.

00:24:59.292 --> 00:25:00.833
[narrator] <i>...but admirable sometimes.</i>

00:25:00.917 --> 00:25:03.250
I've spent my life being a bit 
of an asshole,

00:25:03.333 --> 00:25:07.167
-but today I feel like dying with dignity.
-[sobs, shouts]

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:12.125
It's incredible how a character
with such pejorative traits is loved.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.792
He's always in the top three in the polls.

00:25:15.875 --> 00:25:18.917
People need to get their heads checked.
[laughing]

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.917
Because...

00:25:22.875 --> 00:25:27.125
I'm sure he's not the character
you'd want your daughter to marry.

00:25:27.208 --> 00:25:29.708
You bastard! You son of a bitch.

00:25:29.792 --> 00:25:31.667
-[gun cocks]
-[gasps]

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.917
It's like holding a mirror up to society.
You know, seriously,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.792
"Your favorite character in <i>Money Heist</i>
is this guy."

00:25:37.875 --> 00:25:39.750
-[gags]
-Let's see if you have any balls.

00:25:39.833 --> 00:25:40.792
[yells]

00:25:40.875 --> 00:25:43.292
That dominant side to him,

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:46.083
his leadership,

00:25:46.458 --> 00:25:48.833
repulses us,

00:25:49.083 --> 00:25:51.958
but it gives us a certain sense of safety.

00:25:52.042 --> 00:25:53.583
You and I are the Resistance.

00:25:54.042 --> 00:25:57.167
[Pina] If television is inoffensive 
and not dark, it's boring

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.250
because less things happen, basically.

00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:01.167
The audience wants things to happen

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:06.583
and there's nothing better than a villain
who also provokes feelings of empathy.

00:26:06.667 --> 00:26:10.042
For a moment, I thought
it would be really good to feel...

00:26:11.333 --> 00:26:12.583
how my friend is feeling.

00:26:12.667 --> 00:26:14.875
[narrator] <i>But these characters are risky,</i>

00:26:14.958 --> 00:26:16.500
<i>and in Berlin's case,</i>

00:26:16.583 --> 00:26:19.708
<i>that caused problems</i>
<i>even before the series was released.</i>

00:26:20.792 --> 00:26:21.625
Fear.

00:26:22.208 --> 00:26:23.500
Someone said to me,

00:26:23.833 --> 00:26:26.375
"This character doesn't belong
in our time,

00:26:26.792 --> 00:26:28.750
you should take him out of the series."

00:26:28.833 --> 00:26:30.042
He's contemptible.

00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:33.083
I said I had no intention
of taking him out of the series.

00:26:33.167 --> 00:26:34.667
What kind of shit is in your head?

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.375
He's a misogynist, a narcissist
and a psychopath in many ways,

00:26:37.458 --> 00:26:41.042
but we could have
a character like that in the series

00:26:41.125 --> 00:26:45.458
and the audience could freely decide
whose side they're on, right?

00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:48.625
[narrator] 
<i>The next characteristic of this series:</i>

00:26:48.708 --> 00:26:51.125
<i>nothing and no one is sacred.</i>

00:26:51.208 --> 00:26:53.875
<i>Everyone walks on thin ice.</i>

00:26:55.208 --> 00:26:57.083
WE HAVE NO MERCY

00:26:57.167 --> 00:26:58.958
[speaks English] Ticky boom. Ticky boom. 
Ticky boom. Ticky boom.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.208
[speaking Spanish] Gentlemen,
you have to live to the very end.

00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:07.625
What kind of a kiss was that?

00:27:08.167 --> 00:27:11.458
[narrator] <i>Nairobi, how we loved Nairobi.</i>

00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:13.708
Thank you. Thank you.

00:27:13.792 --> 00:27:16.458
I've never had a boss like you,
Miss Nairobi.

00:27:22.417 --> 00:27:23.833
Today is my last day.

00:27:24.667 --> 00:27:25.708
It's tough.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.542
It's the end of an era for me.

00:27:45.083 --> 00:27:46.042
Yeah.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.875
They say when you die,
your whole life flashes before you,

00:27:55.958 --> 00:27:59.417
and this is a bit like that,
but with the character.

00:28:15.042 --> 00:28:20.833
I like to think that Nairobi wishes
her son a life with more opportunities

00:28:20.917 --> 00:28:23.000
than the one she could have given him

00:28:23.417 --> 00:28:24.792
and a more peaceful one.

00:28:25.417 --> 00:28:28.458
[man] Let's say goodbye
to our colleague Alba Flores.

00:37:41.458 --> 00:37:44.958
The notes, the tempo, the lyrics.

00:37:45.042 --> 00:37:48.750
It has that patriotic,
anthem-like vibe to it.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.458
Then it takes on a new dimension
in the series.

00:38:02.542 --> 00:38:04.000
You start to love "Bella Ciao."

00:38:04.083 --> 00:38:07.375
[singing]

00:38:07.458 --> 00:38:12.250
I can't remember any other sequence
with such utter silence on set.

00:38:12.333 --> 00:38:15.000
It takes on a mythological dimension
when you realize

00:38:15.083 --> 00:38:18.875
that it is emotional territory,
sacred territory, for the characters.

00:38:18.958 --> 00:38:20.167
It was...

[singing]

00:38:23.458 --> 00:38:26.583
...mystical almost,
the song in that sequence.

00:38:28.542 --> 00:38:31.583
[Colmenar] All that iconography
has been one of the reasons,

00:38:31.667 --> 00:38:35.500
if not the most important one,
behind its international success.

00:38:35.583 --> 00:38:39.083
If you do it in normal clothes,
without the masks or "Bella Ciao,"

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.625
I'm quite convinced
it wouldn't have the same impact.

00:38:42.958 --> 00:38:44.375
What are you dressing up as?

00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:49.292
Those three elements have created
a new universe of symbols...

00:38:49.375 --> 00:38:50.458
An iconographic image.

00:38:50.542 --> 00:38:53.417
...that people are using
as a pop culture symbol.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.583
I think people need symbols.

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:58.000
[Koldo Serra]
And it's very easy to recreate and repeat.

00:38:58.083 --> 00:39:01.000
And people can adapt it
to their own needs.

00:39:01.083 --> 00:39:05.083
People dress up for different reasons
in different places.

00:39:05.167 --> 00:39:08.708
But there is always this kind of
underlying fight against the system,

00:39:08.792 --> 00:39:09.958
which people love.

00:39:10.042 --> 00:39:12.417
What does all this mean? It means...

00:39:13.208 --> 00:39:14.958
that it's universal, it's an icon.

00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:20.125
Each person can use the red jumpsuit,
the Dalí mask and "Bella Ciao"

00:39:20.417 --> 00:39:21.667
for their own fight.

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.417

We try to keep very close,
with the shortest time possible

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:46.125
because a lot happens
watching the series in post-production.

where they're taking the script.

We think that you have to
keep your ear to the ground,

to sense where the train is coming from.

00:41:55.542 --> 00:41:59.542
So, the closer the train is,
the more information you have.

-Don't move!

It's always on the edge.
That's when interesting things happen.

00:48:52.583 --> 00:48:55.792
Instead of pumping water into the vault...

00:48:55.875 --> 00:48:57.958
Seven thousand five hundred liters
a minute.

00:48:58.042 --> 00:49:03.375
...what we did was submerge the entire set
in a swimming pool.

00:49:03.625 --> 00:49:07.292
Therefore, the effect,
with a camera tied down on the inside,

00:49:07.375 --> 00:49:11.042
was that the water emerged from below

00:49:11.458 --> 00:49:12.917
and started to rise.

00:49:15.458 --> 00:49:18.250
[alarm sounding]

00:49:18.708 --> 00:49:20.083
The next day: catastrophe.

00:49:23.083 --> 00:49:27.833
[narrator] <i>It turns out that the ingots </i>

00:49:28.792 --> 00:49:30.708
You learn from these things.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
[narrator]<i> We have to do some screwing </i>

00:49:38.083 --> 00:49:38.958

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.667
We're going to do a global show.

All out. A global show all the way.

Photography?
He's not too hot on photography,

00:49:53.875 --> 00:49:57.792
but he's damn good
at putting in screws and drilling ingots.

00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:02.125
[narrator] <i>But when we'd finished,</i>
<i>we discovered this...</i>

00:50:03.708 --> 00:50:05.708
The shelves are rusting.

00:50:06.958 --> 00:50:10.667
We're trying out different liquids
to remove the rust.

00:50:11.333 --> 00:50:13.417
We're using phosphoric acid,

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.792
but when you use phosphoric acid,

00:50:16.917 --> 00:50:18.875
white marks start to appear.

00:50:20.125 --> 00:50:22.708
So now we're learning how
to remove the white marks.

00:50:22.792 --> 00:50:25.958
I'll dive into the lake,
see if I can get anything done today.

00:50:26.042 --> 00:50:30.042
Is it me,

[narrator] <i>You can say that again</i>

<i>The ingots have shrunk.</i>

00:50:40.917 --> 00:50:45.083
We made the ingots from foam
so they'd weigh less,

00:50:45.167 --> 00:50:47.458
the weight made them difficult
to get on set.

00:50:48.208 --> 00:50:49.708
The pressure of the water...

00:50:50.833 --> 00:50:52.500
has done this to our gold ingots.

00:50:52.583 --> 00:50:54.750
What happened? Pressure, once again.

00:50:54.833 --> 00:50:59.083
They'd never been
two and a half meters underwater.

00:50:59.167 --> 00:51:01.667

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:04.333

It wasn't gold. They were raisins.

00:51:04.417 --> 00:51:07.542
We'd been working on them for months.

These things happen.

00:51:10.542 --> 00:51:14.083
[Serra] Everything that happened
was like one catastrophe after another.

00:51:16.917 --> 00:51:19.708
[Hovik Keuchkerian]
It was probably the most tense moment

00:51:19.792 --> 00:51:23.917
with the most pressure
and responsibility involved for all of us

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.042
because things weren't working out.

00:51:26.125 --> 00:51:29.000

[narrator] <i>However...</i>

00:51:53.625 --> 00:51:56.375
[Serra] In Spain, they didn't realize,
"Everything's brilliant."

00:51:56.542 --> 00:51:59.917
But then you'd say, "Look at that.
Christ, take a look at that."

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.917
"Look at that, the ingot is bent."
"Christ, you're right."

<i>One after the other.</i>

00:52:12.292 --> 00:52:15.042
[man] We basically painted
almost all the ingots one by one.

00:52:15.125 --> 00:52:18.083
We had to fix over one thousand ingots.

00:52:18.167 --> 00:52:20.625
It was a crazy amount of shots.

00:52:20.708 --> 00:52:24.000
But the end result looks great
and it's worth the trouble.

00:52:24.083 --> 00:52:28.542
[laughs] Well, I think the digital effects
team will remember us

00:52:28.625 --> 00:52:33.125
Let's say we lost a lot of sleep
during that process. [laughs]

00:52:36.167 --> 00:52:39.833
[Serra] It was no mean feat,
but the material is fantastic.

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.625
I believe those images
are what make all the difference.

00:52:45.708 --> 00:52:49.333
[Amoedo] It's a kind of summary
of how we make <i>Money Heist.</i>

00:52:49.417 --> 00:52:52.375
[Serra] It was quite a commitment.
They could have left it out,

00:52:52.458 --> 00:52:55.708
avoided it or scripted it differently,
so hats off to them.

00:52:57.708 --> 00:53:02.167
<i>Money Heist </i>is not only challenging
for us writers,

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:05.458
but also for the show's directors
who often shoot in extreme conditions.

00:53:06.667 --> 00:53:09.417
It always has to be pushed to the brink.

00:53:09.833 --> 00:53:10.833
Now!

00:53:12.542 --> 00:53:14.500
