You know why I came back for this heist?

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.916
Before you scattered us all across
the world,

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.416
this gang...

00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:15.000
was the closest thing to a family
I've had in my whole life.

00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.458
I've never had a Christmas
like the kind you see on TV

all that shit.

You know, I...

00:04:38.916 --> 00:04:40.791
I had already given up on the idea...

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.000
of having a family.

00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:46.541
Completely given it up.

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:50.833
But now I think
there's another way of doing this thing.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.000
I have this urge to be a mother.

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:57.833
But a different one.
I wanna have a bunch of kids,

00:04:57.916 --> 00:05:00.166
and a dog and whatever else I want.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.083
What you're saying is beautiful, Nairobi.
Very beautiful.

00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.083
Y-you...

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:13.791
Would you be the father of my child?

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:17.083
- I mean...
- Pardon?

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:20.916
I need to get good genes
to combine with mine. It's very important.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.583
I look at you in class,

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:25.291
and I think...

00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.500
"This man is brilliant,

00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:30.208
and he's honorable,

00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:33.041
and so sensitive. Even handsome.

00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:35.458
He's a man with ideals."

00:05:37.375 --> 00:05:39.125
And I believe in what you do.

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:43.583
Your perception of me
is very, very flattering.

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:45.833
And honorable...

00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:49.083
Well, that's one way to look at it, but...

00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:52.291
that's impossible.

00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:55.068
Why? Impossible is pulling off a heist
at the Bank of Spain.

00:05:55.666 --> 00:05:58.458
I'm not asking you to be a father
if you don't want to.

00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:01.208
What I'm asking is a donation

00:06:01.291 --> 00:06:03.083
so I can do things differently.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.500
- No strings attached.

I'm not one
who doesn't develop attachments.

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:22.166
I would not ignore, even for a second,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.333
the fact that I have a child out there
somewhere in the world.

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:27.666
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

00:06:29.166 --> 00:06:31.708
You were the one that built this family.
And you...

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.916
you taught us to look out for each other.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.625
You said, "Whatever it takes."

00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:39.541
- But what you're asking for is...
- What I'm asking you is the same.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.916
Because a family is there for you,
no questions asked.

00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:46.416
That's what binds us.
They will risk their lives for you.

You've got your plan,

00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:51.625
but I also have a plan.

00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:55.250
You've taught me
that we have to help each other

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:57.000
because that's who we are.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.750
Ágata...

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.333

to do more complicated things.

00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:19.458
A little bit more, yeah.

00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:21.458
And...

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.041
I've done fucked up shit for you
without asking.

00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:26.791
I know. I've asked you...

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:28.666
to take big risks.

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:30.416
Serious risks.

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:33.750
In fact, much more
than what you're asking me now.

00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:37.083
Are you saying that's a yes?

00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:40.916

[Tokyo] <i>That song sounded like a requiem.</i>

00:12:44.166 --> 00:12:46.125
<i>A requiem for our own funeral.</i>

00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:49.041
<i>And that bitter reality...</i>

00:12:49.833 --> 00:12:51.708

00:12:52.916 --> 00:12:54.875
[Professor] We're up against the ropes.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.791
Nairobi is knocked out.

00:12:57.833 --> 00:12:59.291
Tokyo is knocked out.

00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:03.375
Lisbon is knocked out.

00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:08.083
Professor.

00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:12.208
Marseille, I can't think clearly.
I have too many emotional attachments.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:15.041
Before, I had a gang of people
with city names. Now...

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.166
now I could be having a child,
not with one,

00:13:18.583 --> 00:13:20.291
but with two members of the gang.

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:24.375
[Marseille] Mixing professional
and personal doesn't work.

00:13:24.458 --> 00:13:26.500
Tokyo is stuck in the panic room.

00:13:27.333 --> 00:13:29.041
And that is precisely the place...

00:13:29.833 --> 00:13:33.750
where Gandía... intends... to hide.

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.916
We need to find that room
and give him no way to escape.

00:13:42.333 --> 00:13:44.208
So where would you put a panic room?

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:46.958
In a place you need to protect.
Where the gold is.

00:13:47.041 --> 00:13:48.041
No.

00:13:48.416 --> 00:13:51.083
These rooms are used to protect lives,
not gold.

00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:53.126
Whose life is most important
in the Bank of Spain?

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.500
- The governor's.
- Exactly.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.250
It must be close to the governor's office.

00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:00.708
But why doesn't it show up in the plans?

00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:02.791
- Perhaps there was a renovation.
- No.

00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:16.791
Palermo, don't respond.

00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:20.250
<i>The panic room
is behind the governor's bathroom.</i>

00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:22.333
<i>It's not in the official blueprints.</i>

00:14:22.416 --> 00:14:26.166
I bet they falsified the measurements
of the adjoining rooms, but trust me

00:14:26.541 --> 00:14:27.541
it's there.

00:14:33.333 --> 00:14:35.916
- [whispers] They're singing church music.
- Huh?

00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:38.375
That's a bad omen, yeah?

00:14:38.458 --> 00:14:41.875
These assholes sing all the time.
They like doing that kind of shit.

00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.375
On the other hand,
those shots we heard... Yeah.

00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:48.041
That could be a sign these bastards
aren't doing so well.

00:14:48.125 --> 00:14:50.142
- Don't you think so, Governor?
- How could we know?

00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:51.208
[man] Ssh!

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.625
I know. The shouting, the grenades,

00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:59.416
and that random guy watching us.
I have no damn clue who he is,

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.375
but he's the tiniest piece of shit
in the gang, and that's a fact.

00:15:02.791 --> 00:15:04.791
We should take advantage of our moment.

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:06.875
We should tip the scales in our favor.

00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.583
A push, a simple tiny push,
could bring us a little closer to victory.

00:15:10.666 --> 00:15:12.875
- [Matías] Ssh!
- [Arturo] If you permit me, Governor,

00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:16.875
I think that that tiny little push
is our responsibility. Yours and mine.

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:20.041
The two of us have to be the ones that...

00:15:20.666 --> 00:15:22.250
save the people in this room.

00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:24.375
[Governor] What we have to do

00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:26.875
- is remain calm and wait.
- [Arturo] Fuck!

00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.333
[Matías] Shut up back there!
I hear you again, I'll start shooting!

00:15:31.625 --> 00:15:34.500
[Arturo] I'll have to disagree with you,
Mr. Governor.

00:15:34.583 --> 00:15:36.625
See, it is your responsibility.

00:15:36.708 --> 00:15:39.666
You just happen to be
the governor of the Bank of Spain!

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.916
It's your responsibility as a man. Fuck!

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:45.458
Make your own decisions,
face your problems,

00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:47.041
and like I always say,

00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:52.750
sometimes it's better to get up
and die on your feet than to live...

00:15:52.833 --> 00:15:54.416
forever and eternally kneeling.

00:15:57.541 --> 00:16:00.125
- You want me to tell you what I think?
- Please do.

00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:02.166
I think you're a clown.

00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:05.833
You put everyone at risk
with your little adventures

00:16:05.916 --> 00:16:09.083
and with your stupid
asinine infomercial speeches.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.833
Leave us in peace.

00:16:11.625 --> 00:16:13.625
And if you want to die on your feet,

00:16:13.708 --> 00:16:15.916
then stand up and do it.

00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:25.250
[Sierra] Grenades,

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:26.750
shooting.

00:16:26.833 --> 00:16:28.250
All in six minutes.

00:16:29.041 --> 00:16:31.833
And look at you so relaxed.
What am I missing, Tamayo?

00:16:31.916 --> 00:16:34.541
- I know just as much as you, Alicia.
- [Sierra] Liar.

00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:37.166
- What's going on in there?
- I said I didn't know.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.875
Then why aren't we intervening?

00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:42.666
When there's shots, the protocol says
we should intervene immediately.

00:16:46.666 --> 00:16:47.708
It's Gandía,

00:16:47.791 --> 00:16:49.666
- the head of security.
- Oh, fuck.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.958
He's inside, free and armed.
He's acting alone on his own accord.

00:16:53.041 --> 00:16:55.250
Wait a minute.
Did you talk to him, or what?

00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:57.166
Mm-hmm.

00:16:57.708 --> 00:17:01.250
You gave him the green light
to start a war in there and kill everyone?

00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:03.458
My official command
was he remain inactive.

00:17:03.541 --> 00:17:06.416
He said he didn't give a shit
and plans to defend himself.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.500
And if he wants to defend himself,
I'm not going to stop him.

00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:12.958
You piece of shit, Tamayo.
Out there, you look like a saint.

00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:16.916
Worried about your image in the eyes
of the public, calling a pointless truce.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.583
In the meantime, you send some crazy fuck
to do all the dirty work.

00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:23.833
If it goes well, you'll get a medal.
If it goes wrong, you'll say,

00:17:23.916 --> 00:17:26.291
"Shit. I told him, no,
but you know he was fucking <i>loco."</i>

00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:28.855
It's always us, the fucking crazy ones,
doing the dirty work...

00:17:28.916 --> 00:17:32.166
Wait. Do you have anything against Gandía
starting a war in there?

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.416
Do you have anything against him
hurting them or killing them?

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.583
No, right?

00:17:37.083 --> 00:17:38.916
It's better we keep our mouths shut.

00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:47.791
- Are you thinking, Professor?
- Um, Yes. I'm thinking, yes.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.083
- [Marseille] What about...
- When was...

00:17:51.166 --> 00:17:53.416
the first moment that we lost control?

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.791
<i>When Denver went out with the red boxes
instead of Gandía.</i>

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.290
- And the second time?
- [Lisbon] <i>We have a problem.</i>

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.333
When Lisbon wasn't able to climb...
the tree.

00:18:05.416 --> 00:18:08.791
Those were the two mistakes
that put us against the ropes.

00:18:10.916 --> 00:18:14.083
We need to take a step back...

00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:18.250
and reverse them.

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:20.958
I'm gonna exercise
to get my brain working.

00:18:21.041 --> 00:18:22.041
Palermo.

00:18:23.541 --> 00:18:24.833
Hang in there. Got it?

00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:27.708
<i>Hang in there.</i>

I have something to help with
that push you were talking about.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.500
[Arturo] What?

00:18:55.916 --> 00:18:58.083
- It's a cellphone.
- No! Hide it. Holy fuck!

00:18:58.541 --> 00:19:01.083
It's Nairobi's.
The one sent in by the police.

00:19:07.416 --> 00:19:08.875
I found it while cleaning.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.583
You'll know what to do with it.

00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:16.083
What the fuck is going on back there?

00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:18.666
If I hear one more fuckin' breath,
I'll shoot you.

00:19:25.916 --> 00:19:27.916
Sir, I need to go to the bathroom. Now.

00:19:28.666 --> 00:19:31.166
Now is not the time.
No one's gonna leave here,

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.208
so you're gonna sit down and stay calm.

- No problem.

[Julia scoffs]

00:19:56.416 --> 00:19:57.333
What's up, Daniel?

00:19:57.416 --> 00:19:59.601
- I was in the middle of my meal...
- No, no. Not Daniel.

00:19:59.625 --> 00:20:01.708
Not Daniel. Here... Here, I'm Denver.

00:20:02.125 --> 00:20:03.000
Okay? Denver.

00:20:03.083 --> 00:20:06.291
I'm sorry. It's hard to get used
to your new identity. I'm sorry.

00:20:07.208 --> 00:20:09.375
Hmm. Well, that, uh...

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.250
- Look, there's just a couple of things...
- Mm-hmm.

00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:16.166
...that I'd like to understand,
and it's not easy for me.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.333
[Julia laughs softly]

00:20:18.125 --> 00:20:20.250
Ask away.
I'm the same person I've always been.

00:20:20.333 --> 00:20:23.416
Well, not exactly the same person
because now you've got tits.

00:20:24.208 --> 00:20:26.291
- Hmm, well...
- Yeah, you've got tits.

00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:28.208
- I got tits. Mm-hmm.
- You're a woman.

00:20:28.291 --> 00:20:30.000
That part is already clear for me.

00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:35.000
Are you gay too?
Or how does that stuff work?

00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:41.500
So, what you're worried about right now
is knowing whether I'm into guys or not?

00:20:41.583 --> 00:20:42.750
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

00:20:44.291 --> 00:20:46.625
Hmm. Well, I like men. It's true, yeah.

00:20:46.708 --> 00:20:48.833
- I like them a lot, actually.
- Right. Okay.

00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:51.583
But hang on.
I don't like just any kind of man.

00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:56.083
Um, I like them strong, you know?
I like gym rats.

00:20:56.166 --> 00:20:59.750
Punks, but they have to read
a little bit too so I can learn from them.

00:20:59.833 --> 00:21:02.250
Um... They have to watch football.
I like that.

00:21:02.333 --> 00:21:04.833
But they have to watch like a true macho,
you know,

00:21:04.916 --> 00:21:07.416
with a beer in their hand
and their legs spread wide open...

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.583
Okay, okay. I got it already.
I got it. It's crystal clear.

00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:11.958
Have you...

00:21:12.416 --> 00:21:14.375
Have you always liked men,

00:21:14.458 --> 00:21:16.791
or did this happen
after you became a woman?

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:17.875
First of all,

00:21:17.916 --> 00:21:19.666
I've always been a woman.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.500
No.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.250
You haven't always been a woman.
I saw you rob gas stations.

00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:26.500
- You weren't a woman.
- How does a woman rob?

00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:28.875
Do they scratch people
and pull their hair?

00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:32.083
I'm not a Neanderthal.
What I'm talking about, it's just that,

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:34.583
usually you can tell it's a woman.
You can tell.

00:21:34.666 --> 00:21:37.833
I went on all these robberies
with Juanito, not a woman.

00:21:38.416 --> 00:21:41.166
Right?
Maybe this thing about being a woman...

00:21:41.875 --> 00:21:43.000
happened later.

00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:47.000
Let me tell you something.

00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:51.375
When Juanito
got out of a robbery with you,

00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:54.791
- he'd go back home into his room.
- Yeah.

00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:57.833
He'd put on a little music.

00:21:58.416 --> 00:22:00.625
- He'd roll a little joint...
- [laughs]

00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:04.416
...and put on some red lipstick.
Italian lipstick. It looked wonderful.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.416
Ferrari red.
And he'd take his little joint,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.250
and he'd lie down on the bed...

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.416
and right there in that moment...

00:22:15.041 --> 00:22:18.333
alone, relaxed, looking gorgeous...

00:22:18.416 --> 00:22:19.416
[laughs]

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.625
...that was the moment I was me, for real.

00:22:24.666 --> 00:22:26.041
You've always been a woman.

00:22:27.208 --> 00:22:28.208
Always.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.166
And I never realized.

00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:34.416
Do you know
who made me really horny back then?

00:22:36.625 --> 00:22:38.250
[laughs] Of course I know.

00:22:38.333 --> 00:22:39.458
- Yeah?
- Of course I do.

00:22:39.541 --> 00:22:41.833
David Beckham.
You talked about him all day.

00:22:41.916 --> 00:22:45.333
- Fucking David Beckham.
- Beckham, too. I mean, he's sexy, but no.

00:22:45.416 --> 00:22:46.833
Um, you.

00:22:47.625 --> 00:22:49.166
You turn me on so much.

00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:54.875
I didn't turn you on at all.

00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:56.838
- I was in love with you.
- What are you saying?

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:59.375
- You don't mess around with love.
- Think about it.

00:22:59.458 --> 00:23:02.142
Why do you think I was with you
all day long, doing jobs or whatever?

00:23:02.166 --> 00:23:03.166
To be close to you.

00:23:03.208 --> 00:23:05.833
- Are you being serious?
- Of course. What do you mean?

00:23:05.916 --> 00:23:09.101
I'd grope you all the time on the bike.
I touched you all day, you never noticed.

00:23:09.125 --> 00:23:11.333
- I'd touch your leg, your back...
- Stop.

00:23:11.416 --> 00:23:13.336
- And your smell!
- Wait a second! Okay, hold on.

00:23:13.416 --> 00:23:16.541
Do you even realize what you're saying?
This is really serious.

00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:18.250
You were taking advantage of me.

00:23:20.375 --> 00:23:21.916
I'm screwing with you, moron.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.541
- [Julia] It's just...
- Mother...

00:23:23.625 --> 00:23:25.166
Motherfucker!

00:23:25.708 --> 00:23:27.291
Come on. Give me a hug.

00:23:41.166 --> 00:23:43.416
I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm not gonna piss myself.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.666
Nobody move!
I don't wanna hear a fuckin' sound! Hey!

00:23:50.583 --> 00:23:51.583
[Matías] Hey!

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.708
[Arturo] Miguel... Miguel, listen.

00:23:56.125 --> 00:23:59.000
We need to figure out a way
to communicate safely with the outside.

00:23:59.083 --> 00:24:00.083
You get it?

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.750
Take it. Hide it.

00:24:02.583 --> 00:24:05.000
Keep it. They'll always
be suspicious of me, but not you.

00:24:12.541 --> 00:24:14.958
- What are you doing here?
- [Julia] What the fuck?

00:24:16.166 --> 00:24:17.875
What's happening? Where's Denver?

00:24:17.958 --> 00:24:19.541
- Denver's fine.
- [Gandía] Who's there?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.625
- [Helsinki] It's a hostage.
- Get her out now, Matías!

00:24:23.708 --> 00:24:26.166
- Let's go.
- Fuck, no. I'm staying. Give me a gun.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.500
That's not why you're here, Manila.
Get going.

00:24:28.583 --> 00:24:30.708
You guys are in trouble. Give me a pistol.

00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:36.166
Get out of here right now.

00:24:36.666 --> 00:24:37.750
Let's fucking go.

00:24:38.916 --> 00:24:39.958
It's okay.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.916
Look, from this moment on,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.708
you and I are gonna be
the main part of the resistance.

00:24:53.208 --> 00:24:55.248
I'm gonna have a heart attack
just listening to you.

00:25:07.333 --> 00:25:08.333
[Rio] <i>Denver.</i>

00:25:10.416 --> 00:25:11.833
<i>It'll take four seconds at most.</i>

00:25:13.333 --> 00:25:15.541
One goes for it.
The other stays and covers.

00:25:15.625 --> 00:25:16.625
<i>And we save Nairobi.</i>

00:25:16.708 --> 00:25:18.458
[Palermo] <i>Gandía. What do you want?</i>

00:25:18.541 --> 00:25:20.416
<i>- Let's negotiate.
- </i>[Gandía] <i>Negotiate?</i>

00:25:20.833 --> 00:25:22.625
Look, let me explain the situation.

00:25:23.125 --> 00:25:24.125
Option one:

00:25:24.541 --> 00:25:27.666
I come out of this room with the gun
pointed at Nairobi's head.

00:25:28.375 --> 00:25:31.166
<i>All of you stay back
against the wall on the right.</i>

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.791
<i>I let her go, and nobody dies.</i>

00:25:33.875 --> 00:25:37.375
<i>It's a good deal for both sides.
Zero-zero. A tie.</i>

00:25:37.875 --> 00:25:39.125
<i>Option number two:</i>

00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:42.375
<i>instead of me going out, you come in.</i>

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:44.708
I blow Nairobi's head off her neck.

00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:46.625
<i>You shoot me.</i>

00:25:46.708 --> 00:25:49.291
I'd still have another hand left
to shoot at you,

00:25:49.375 --> 00:25:52.541
and I swear to God, I'm gonna take
more than one of you with me.

00:25:52.625 --> 00:25:54.041
You forgot option three.

00:25:54.125 --> 00:25:57.791
<i>You come out on your knees, unarmed,
and surrender and give us Nairobi.</i>

00:25:57.875 --> 00:25:59.875
That's also a tie. What do you think?

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:02.583
I wouldn't kneel down,
not even before God Almighty.

00:26:02.666 --> 00:26:05.666
<i>I'll give you one minute.
After that, I'll start shooting.</i>

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.500
<i>- And I'll score at least six-zero.</i>
- [laughing]

00:26:08.583 --> 00:26:10.583
[Nairobi] <i>You fucking moron!</i>

00:26:10.666 --> 00:26:13.125
Gandía,
you're not getting out of this alive.

00:26:13.208 --> 00:26:16.750
[laughing] You're a fucking clown.
The other day...

00:26:18.125 --> 00:26:21.250
when Tokyo and I broke in,
we made you look like such an idiot.

00:26:21.333 --> 00:26:22.583
- Shut up.
- [Nairobi laughs]

00:26:22.666 --> 00:26:24.416
And Tokyo... [laughs]

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.000
...used the dumbest fucking trick
with the water.

00:26:27.083 --> 00:26:28.958
Shut your fucking mouth right now.

00:26:29.666 --> 00:26:30.916
[Nairobi] You fucking ate

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.750
- the door handle.
- [Gandía] Shut up!

00:26:32.833 --> 00:26:34.458
You got knocked out so hard...

00:26:34.541 --> 00:26:36.458
- [Nairobi laughs]
- What is she doing?

00:26:36.541 --> 00:26:40.416
What happened
to your little macho balls then, huh?

00:26:41.291 --> 00:26:44.000
- [Nairobi laughs] So amateur.
- She wants to save Tokyo.

00:26:44.083 --> 00:26:45.958
You're useless! [laughs]

00:26:46.041 --> 00:26:48.375
She knows that if he kills her,
we'll kill him.

00:26:48.458 --> 00:26:52.125
[Nairobi] You've been training for this
your whole fucking life, right?

00:26:52.208 --> 00:26:54.583
<i>You had all your little soldier friends,</i>

00:26:54.666 --> 00:26:57.541
then two girls show up and make a fool
of you like that.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.250
- Want me to shoot you right now?
- Surprise me.

00:27:01.041 --> 00:27:03.291
How about I put a bullet up your asshole?

00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:09.916
[inhales sharply]

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
[grunts]

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.500
We have to get her out.
We have to get her out now.

00:27:18.958 --> 00:27:20.625
If we let him get out of there,

00:27:20.708 --> 00:27:23.791
<i>he's gonna do whatever he wants.
I don't trust his word,</i>

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:26.583
- we have to be patient.
- [Bogotá] <i>Fuck your patience.</i>

00:27:26.666 --> 00:27:29.708
<i>She's in there because of you.
You helped him get free.</i>

00:27:30.208 --> 00:27:31.375
<i>We have to get her out.</i>

00:27:31.875 --> 00:27:33.166
<i>Everyone agree?</i>

00:27:37.875 --> 00:27:38.916
Okay, Gandía.

00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:41.000
<i>We're gonna let you out.</i>

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.041
Okay. Very good.

00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:45.000
<i>This is how it's gonna go...</i>

00:27:45.083 --> 00:27:47.208
<i>You'll be seeing Nairobi the entire time.</i>

00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:51.291
We're gonna walk forward together
as I point my gun against her head,

00:27:51.375 --> 00:27:55.333
<i>until she confirms everyone's standing
against the wall in the corridor,</i>

00:27:55.916 --> 00:27:59.333
starting with
those two little fucking kids up there!

00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:02.833
Denver, Rio, hear that?

00:28:02.916 --> 00:28:05.416
- <i>You have to come down here.</i>
- Okay, okay, okay.

00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:22.416
Earlier, you asked me if my husband
was too disgusted to sleep with me,

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.541
and I didn't answer.

00:28:24.291 --> 00:28:25.291
Well, no.

00:28:25.666 --> 00:28:27.791
I didn't disgust him. [chuckles]

00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:31.208
Because I wasn't a bitch back then.

00:28:38.125 --> 00:28:39.541
But now I guess I am.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.041
And yeah, we had sex.

00:28:43.125 --> 00:28:44.458
We did it everywhere.

00:28:45.583 --> 00:28:47.833
And it's fascinating how creative we were.

00:28:47.916 --> 00:28:52.500
I imagine you and the Professor are more
like a once a month kind of couple, right?

00:28:52.583 --> 00:28:53.916
And always missionary.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.541
Money can't buy it all.

00:28:56.416 --> 00:29:00.166
All that poison inside of you
is eating you away, Alicia.

00:29:00.791 --> 00:29:02.208
I can see it in your face.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.291
What's wrong? My face?

00:29:10.208 --> 00:29:13.458
You're not yourself.
All this talk about sex. What's wrong?

00:29:13.541 --> 00:29:14.666
Is it the hormones?

00:29:15.333 --> 00:29:16.916
I don't know. Download an app.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.666
There's a million perverts
who'd like to fuck a pregnant lady.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.875
I prefer getting to know the other person.

00:29:22.291 --> 00:29:25.000
I don't date the first geek
that I meet at a bar

00:29:25.083 --> 00:29:27.416
that gives me his phone and says...
[panting]

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.750
"Hey, gorgeous. Why don't you come with me
to my warehouse

00:29:30.833 --> 00:29:33.000
and taste my cider?
It's really tasty."

00:29:33.083 --> 00:29:34.750
You know what your problem is?

00:29:35.833 --> 00:29:37.750
- Tell me.
- If your mask crumbles,

00:29:37.833 --> 00:29:39.125
everything else does.

00:29:39.958 --> 00:29:42.250
You're a step away from a breakdown.

00:29:42.333 --> 00:29:43.625
And I get it. I get...

00:29:46.208 --> 00:29:48.083
I'm not the one with a mask on.

00:29:48.875 --> 00:29:52.083
Let's see. Earlier, hmm,
the two of us had a deal.

00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:54.041
You were holding the phone,

00:29:54.916 --> 00:29:56.291
then you changed your mind.

00:29:57.583 --> 00:29:58.625
What happened?

00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:03.083
I made you waste your time
while you were questioning me.

00:30:03.916 --> 00:30:06.625
I pretended you were breaking me
little by little

00:30:06.708 --> 00:30:08.333
and that I was about to give in.

00:30:08.416 --> 00:30:12.000
In the meantime, he slipped
through your fingers. He escaped.

00:30:12.083 --> 00:30:14.833
It's called diversion tactics,

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.416
and it worked well.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.416
You know what I think?

00:30:21.083 --> 00:30:24.333
Your little shepherd somehow found a way
to make it here in time.

00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:29.083
I'll find out how.

00:30:30.458 --> 00:30:31.458
You'll see.

00:30:37.916 --> 00:30:39.750
[rock music playing]

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.500
[screams]

00:30:46.458 --> 00:30:48.538
- [Berlin] <i>Think.
- </i>[Rio] <i>I knew we weren't in Spain.</i>

00:30:49.875 --> 00:30:51.791
<i>I heard the prayer call from a mosque.</i>

00:30:52.541 --> 00:30:54.208
[Berlin] <i>Think. You know how.</i>

00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:56.208
<i>Fly with me.</i>

00:31:06.666 --> 00:31:07.666
Shakir.

00:31:08.375 --> 00:31:09.875
[professor]<i> Shakir, do you hear me?</i>

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.833
Yes. This is Shakir. Go ahead, Professor.

00:31:12.916 --> 00:31:15.208
I need you to track
Rio's airplane to Spain.

00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:16.875
It's a Beechcraft Air King 250.

00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:18.666
<i>Property of the Spanish Air Force.</i>

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.333
The flight landed at exactly 4:30 p.m.
on April 4th.

00:31:21.416 --> 00:31:24.333
<i>Look for that plane
in every navigation satellite.</i>

00:31:24.416 --> 00:31:26.625
<i>I need you to find
the exact point of origin.</i>

00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:34.458
[Arturo] Does it have battery?

00:31:35.541 --> 00:31:37.708
- It does.
- And reception?

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:42.833
[Miguel] Yes, sir.

00:31:42.916 --> 00:31:44.541
Okay. Go to outgoing calls.

00:31:45.583 --> 00:31:48.333
Miguel, for fuck's sake.
You need to keep a cool head

00:31:48.416 --> 00:31:51.208
You understand me?
You are never going to be suspicious.

00:31:51.291 --> 00:31:54.083
- But my fingers are really sweaty.
- Then calm down!

00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:00.708
[Miguel] There's one call.
A private number.

00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:02.833
- Go to contacts.
- [Miguel breathes heavy]

00:32:03.916 --> 00:32:05.000
[Miguel] There's a number.

00:32:06.458 --> 00:32:07.458
Call it.

00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:10.625
Oh, God. Please don't answer.

00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:13.125
INCOMING CALL

00:32:13.791 --> 00:32:15.500
It's the phone we gave to Nairobi.

00:32:15.583 --> 00:32:17.916
[beeping]

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.892
- [Arturo] What are you doing?
- I'm not talking.

00:32:19.916 --> 00:32:21.791
- [Arturo] Fuck!
- They called and hung up.

00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:26.208
I'm leaving my fingerprints.
I don't wanna call the police!

00:32:26.291 --> 00:32:27.125
Listen.

00:32:27.208 --> 00:32:29.750
All you have to do
is leave the phone connected.

00:32:29.833 --> 00:32:33.166
Then you talk to me casual.
A normal conversation between hostages.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.375
When they hear it,
they'll know what to do.

00:32:36.083 --> 00:32:37.083
You got it?

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.250
[dramatic music playing]

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.125
They're calling again.

00:32:45.208 --> 00:32:46.291
[Miguel] <i>Speak.</i>

00:32:46.375 --> 00:32:47.375
[Arturo] <i>So...</i>

00:32:48.916 --> 00:32:50.166
here we are...

00:32:50.583 --> 00:32:51.625
<i>in the library.</i>

00:32:52.208 --> 00:32:55.250
<i>All together, and we're just being
watched by one of them.</i>

00:32:55.666 --> 00:32:57.750
<i>Random guy. I think his name's Matías.</i>

00:32:57.833 --> 00:33:00.791
- Turn the volume all the way up.
- I think it's Arturo Román.

00:33:00.875 --> 00:33:02.875
No one's in the hall, right, Miguel?

00:33:03.208 --> 00:33:04.416
[loudly] There's nobody.

00:33:07.541 --> 00:33:09.791
- [whispers] I can't use my voice, sir.
- Ssh!

00:33:09.875 --> 00:33:11.875
And now since that guy escaped, Gandía,

00:33:11.958 --> 00:33:15.000
<i>I think it'd be the perfect time
for the police to come in</i>

00:33:15.083 --> 00:33:16.083
<i>because, I repeat,</i>

00:33:16.125 --> 00:33:18.583
there's no one in the main hall.

00:33:18.666 --> 00:33:21.958
<i>Thank God we're okay. We're scared.
There was a shooting, a grenade,</i>

00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:24.375
screaming, even religious chants.
It's nuts. Right, Miguel?

00:33:24.458 --> 00:33:27.541
- [loudly] That's right.
- [Miguel coughs]

00:33:28.333 --> 00:33:30.375
I'm sorry. [coughs]

00:33:30.458 --> 00:33:32.583
[Miguel coughs and pants]

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.500
We need to go in. Fuck!

00:33:34.583 --> 00:33:37.143
The President doesn't want any
armored vans to approach the bank.

00:33:37.208 --> 00:33:40.458
For fuck's sake! They're not looking.
We'll catch them off guard.

00:33:41.083 --> 00:33:42.166
I can't do it!

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.625
What are you guys doing?

00:33:44.791 --> 00:33:47.458
It's this kid.
He's lost it. He's really nervous.

00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:49.208
Poor little guy. He was praying.

00:33:49.291 --> 00:33:51.666
- I think so. What do I know?
- Come here.

00:33:53.333 --> 00:33:56.041
Sit over here and be quiet,
nice and close to me.

00:33:56.708 --> 00:33:58.625
Raise your hands where I can see them.

00:33:58.708 --> 00:34:03.291
If you lower them an inch, I'll shoot you.
If you move an inch, I'll shoot you.

00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:06.458
And if you say even one fucking word...

00:34:06.541 --> 00:34:08.666
- You'll shoot me.
- Yes, I'll shoot you.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.416
- I'm thinking about shooting you anyway.
- Copy.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.041
Ssh. Quiet.

00:34:16.416 --> 00:34:20.250
Suarez, get an intervention unit ready.
We're going in through the main hall.

00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:23.041
And Call Gandía in the panic room
so we can coordinate.

00:34:23.125 --> 00:34:25.875
Fucking finally.
I didn't think you had any balls.

00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:30.333
[dramatic music intesifies]

00:34:38.791 --> 00:34:39.791
[Shakir] <i>Professor.</i>

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.458
<i>The Beechcraft Air King 250,</i>

00:34:43.541 --> 00:34:47.833
the one that flew Rio to Spain,
took off from Algeria at 3:03 p.m...

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.708
<i>from a village named Timimoun.
It's located in the Atlas Mountains.</i>

00:34:58.916 --> 00:34:59.916
[Professor] Good.

00:34:59.958 --> 00:35:02.541
That's minutes before
the car with Rio got there.

00:35:02.625 --> 00:35:04.705
It's right by the plane.
I need you to find that car.

00:35:05.166 --> 00:35:07.309
<i>I can see the whole area is a desert.
There's no trees,</i>

00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:09.708
so we should be able to trace it
through the satellite

00:35:09.791 --> 00:35:11.833
- and find where the car came from.
- <i>Okay.</i>

00:35:11.916 --> 00:35:14.000
We'll start with the weather satellites.

00:35:14.083 --> 00:35:15.083
Very good.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.708
You're going to Algeria.
In four hours, I want you in Timimoun.

00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:27.625
I can't fly with weapons.

00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:30.333
I know. Once you get there,
everything will be ready.

00:35:30.833 --> 00:35:34.958
- The plan was not to leave you alone.
- The plan has just changed, Marseille.

00:35:35.375 --> 00:35:37.750
I need all the Serbs
and Benjamin's team

00:35:37.833 --> 00:35:39.333
to go on the offensive.

00:35:39.416 --> 00:35:41.875
We're gonna hit them so much,
so fast and so hard

00:35:41.958 --> 00:35:44.208
that they won't even know
where the hits are coming from.

00:36:06.041 --> 00:36:07.041
How are you doing?

00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:10.000
My stitches...

00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:12.166
are coming out.

00:36:14.083 --> 00:36:15.166
[Denver] Where is he?

00:36:15.916 --> 00:36:17.083
[Nairobi] I don't know.

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:18.958
Where is he?

00:36:22.291 --> 00:36:23.291
[Palermo] Denver...

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.750
I don't know.

00:36:32.541 --> 00:36:34.916
Here we are, you son of a fucking bitch.

00:36:36.291 --> 00:36:37.666
[Gandía] And the other one?

00:36:38.625 --> 00:36:39.791
I'm right here.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.166
Good.
Then I'm gonna start releasing Nairobi.

00:36:48.083 --> 00:36:52.666
Mutt, would you like to say something
before we begin to dance?

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:53.666
[gulps]

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.875
[Gandía] Well? Well...

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.708
- Party time?
- Party time.

00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:12.458
[inhales sharply]

00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:14.500
[panting]

00:37:14.583 --> 00:37:15.750
Nairobi.

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.500
[Nairobi] <i>Hey, sleepyhead!</i>

00:37:17.583 --> 00:37:20.458
[laughs] You've gotta be a real badass
to sleep like this

00:37:20.541 --> 00:37:22.833
while everyone's waiting for you
at the table.

00:37:22.916 --> 00:37:24.333
You staying in bed all day?

00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:26.291
- [Tokyo] Hm? So sleepy.
- Hey!

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.500
[Tokyo] What?

00:37:29.666 --> 00:37:30.791
He said yes.

00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:35.000
The Professor.

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:39.291
He said yes. [both laugh]

00:37:41.708 --> 00:37:43.583
- You're going to be an aunt!
- An aunt!

00:37:43.666 --> 00:37:44.916
[both scream and laugh]

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.583
- [Tokyo] I'm so happy for you.
- I can't believe it!

00:37:47.666 --> 00:37:49.375
- [Tokyo] Hey...
- What?

00:37:49.458 --> 00:37:51.017
You'll have a little nerd in the house.

00:37:51.041 --> 00:37:53.041
[Nairobi] <i>Yeah. What are we gonna name it?</i>

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
[Nairobi] <i>Hmm?</i>

00:37:58.125 --> 00:37:59.208
Ibiza.

00:37:59.708 --> 00:38:01.375
[Nairobi gasps]

00:38:01.458 --> 00:38:03.458
Oh, my God. I love it. Ibiza.

00:38:03.875 --> 00:38:06.583
- [Nairobi] <i>I love it!</i>
- [Tokyo] <i>You call the baby Ibiza,</i>

00:38:07.291 --> 00:38:09.958
and you're gonna have
so much fucking fun together.

00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:12.750
Fuck. It's gonna be so popular
in high school.

00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:15.208
[Tokyo] <i>It's not a city.
It's an island.</i>

00:38:15.291 --> 00:38:18.416
[Nairobi] Fuck it, you know
what other rule we're gonna break?

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.916
Not seeing each other again.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.583
You're gonna be an aunt.

00:38:22.583 --> 00:38:23.958
[Nairobi] <i>You know what?</i>

00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:25.708
You're gonna be a godmother.

00:38:26.708 --> 00:38:28.000
That's right, baby.

00:38:28.916 --> 00:38:31.000
- [Nairobi laughs]
- [Tokyo] I can't wait.

00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:32.250
[Nairobi] Me neither!

00:38:33.583 --> 00:38:35.125
[Nairobi sighs] Me neither.

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:40.416
I can't believe it.

00:38:41.041 --> 00:38:43.333
- [Tokyo] Mm.
- What? What?

00:38:43.708 --> 00:38:45.916
- Ibiza, right?
- Yes! I'll tell you one thing.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.916
I'm not spending any more Christmases
alone with Helsinki.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.875
He doesn't know any Christmas carols.

00:38:50.958 --> 00:38:53.833
From now on,
every Christmas is for family.

00:38:53.916 --> 00:38:56.208
- What's going on here?
- What are you doing?

00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:59.875
Single mother bachelorette party.

00:38:59.958 --> 00:39:02.083
- [Nairobi] Whoo!
- Are you pregnant?

00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:05.500
Yeah! No, no, no, no. After the heist.
I will be after the heist.

00:39:05.583 --> 00:39:07.958
- I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
- Me neither.

00:39:08.041 --> 00:39:08.958
[Lisbon] What?

00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:10.333
A friend with benefits.

00:39:10.416 --> 00:39:11.625
- [Lisbon] Awesome.
- Okay.

00:39:11.708 --> 00:39:14.458
- [Tokyo] Wanna know the baby's name?
- [together] Ibiza!

00:39:14.541 --> 00:39:15.916
[dance music plays]

00:39:26.833 --> 00:39:28.083
[screams]

00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:29.250
[Gandía] <i>Okay, mutt.</i>

00:39:35.625 --> 00:39:36.625
[Nairobi moans]

00:39:39.708 --> 00:39:42.625
[Gandía] I want everyone against the wall.
Lower your guns.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
I'd ask you to throw them on the floor,

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:48.750
but I know myself,
and if I saw you unarmed,

00:39:48.833 --> 00:39:50.250
I'd get too excited.

00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:52.916
So we should show a little mutual respect.
Right?

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:55.625
[Palermo] Down.

00:39:55.875 --> 00:39:58.000
[Gandía] Come on. Yeah.

00:39:58.083 --> 00:40:00.083
I'm aiming my gun at her head.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.208
I'm wearing a bulletproof vest,
and she's tied up,

00:40:03.291 --> 00:40:06.583
so I wouldn't try anything crazy
if I were you. Come on. Let's go.

00:40:13.666 --> 00:40:16.583
Lower your fucking gun, asshole!
Aren't you listening?

00:40:21.083 --> 00:40:22.125
There.

00:40:22.583 --> 00:40:24.833
Slowly. Slowly.

00:40:30.083 --> 00:40:31.708
Shall we dance a little bit?

00:40:31.791 --> 00:40:33.250
Come on. Let's dance.

00:40:33.333 --> 00:40:36.625
[Gandía hums a silly tune]

00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:41.000
- Darling, you're falling.
- [groaning]

00:40:41.083 --> 00:40:42.791
[Gandía] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:40:44.125 --> 00:40:45.125
Look at your fatty.

00:40:45.166 --> 00:40:47.333
Hello, fatty! [laughs]

00:40:47.416 --> 00:40:48.416
That's enough.

00:40:49.416 --> 00:40:50.583
Let her go now.
