00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:52.875
This thing.

00:11:57.541 --> 00:11:59.541
- You were making this?
- Yep.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
[sighs]

00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:07.708
You beat the shit out of a guy,

00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.500
completely shattering her image of you,

00:12:11.541 --> 00:12:14.625
and you try to fix it
by giving her a little golden heart?

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.333
What should I have done?

00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:19.916
Change.

00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.791
[blows smoke] In her eyes,

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.125
you're the bad guy now.

00:12:26.583 --> 00:12:27.791
A violent guy.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.958
Tell me how you fell in love.

00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:32.833
I shot her in the leg.

00:12:32.916 --> 00:12:35.083
- [coughing]
- No, I shot her in the leg

00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:37.833
so I could save her life.
To save her life.

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:39.208
[Bogotácoughing]

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:40.291
I don't know.

00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:43.708
[laughs softly]

00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:46.416
I showed her some dance moves.

00:12:47.416 --> 00:12:48.916
- You danced for her?
- Yeah.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.708
I danced for her.

00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:52.958
- [laughs]
- I don’t know. I told her stories.

00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:54.875
We laughed a lot.

00:12:57.083 --> 00:12:58.541
And...

00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:02.333
when was the last time
you told her stories?

00:13:02.708 --> 00:13:04.833
When was the last time you made her laugh?

00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:07.625
When was the last time you danced for her?

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:24.250
Hey, Rio. Could you bring me
a little coffee, please?

00:13:25.833 --> 00:13:29.708
I came up with this plan. If you're safe
here today, it’s because of me.

00:13:29.791 --> 00:13:31.041
Have some gratitude.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.291
You're stuck there,
so why don't you get some rest?

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:36.875
At least a little water.
That's all I want, please.

00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:39.666
Just a little water?

00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:48.708
[sighs]

00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:51.041
I'm sorry, friend, but...

00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:53.083
Thank you.

00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:55.708
You look tired.

00:13:56.083 --> 00:13:57.083
Can't you sleep?

00:14:01.416 --> 00:14:04.250
You're waking up three, four times
a night at least, huh?

00:14:11.416 --> 00:14:12.416
Hey, Rio...

00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:17.041
if you need anything... to talk
or anything, I'm here. Okay?

00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:21.375
Thank you.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.583
That's the weakest link.

00:14:32.666 --> 00:14:35.875
Palpitations,
excessive sweating, insomnia.

00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:39.250
You have to break free during his watch.

00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:41.541
He won't be able to pull the trigger.

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:47.083
What makes you think I won't kill you
as soon as I'm free?

00:14:47.166 --> 00:14:48.166
Well...

00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.500
I bashed your head in.

00:14:50.583 --> 00:14:52.250
You fucked up my eyes.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.750
Even.

00:14:54.208 --> 00:14:55.666
A pact between gentlemen.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.625
Are you asking me to trust you,
you piece of shit?

00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:01.958
I'm telling you
they've declared a truce out there.

00:15:02.666 --> 00:15:04.375
Armored vans aren't breaking in.

00:15:05.708 --> 00:15:09.583
We're in a fucking Cold War,
and you and I are all alone.

00:15:09.666 --> 00:15:10.666
And?

00:15:11.375 --> 00:15:15.166
And I'm gonna turn you into the chaos
that this heist needs.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:19.166
Into <i>Alien: The Eighth Passenger.</i>

00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:25.500
Into John McClane... from <i>Die Hard.</i>

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:31.166
[dramatic music playing]

00:15:36.791 --> 00:15:38.708
STORM RESERVOIR
KEEP OUT

00:15:58.875 --> 00:15:59.958
[Professor] <i>Let's go.</i>

00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:16.708
[dramatic music continues]

00:16:31.416 --> 00:16:33.541
[Tokyo] <i>The Professor arrived
at the storm reservoir</i>

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:34.833
<i>thinking about Raquel.</i>

00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:39.166
<i>Just like Alberto did
when he stepped into the ambulance.</i>

00:16:43.291 --> 00:16:46.333
<i>It's fascinating how two people
can think about someone...</i>

00:16:46.833 --> 00:16:47.958
<i>at the same time...</i>

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.541
<i>in very different ways.</i>

00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:54.166
<i>They say that love can move worlds...</i>

00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:57.333
<i>but the truth is,
hate can be just as strong.</i>

00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:03.250
- [Professor] <i>You were right.</i>
- [sighs]

00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:04.333
<i>Lisbon's alive.</i>

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:07.958
Where is she?

00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:10.841
For the moment, she's in the tent.
I imagine they're interrogating her.

00:17:10.916 --> 00:17:12.333
<i>How long can they keep her there?</i>

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.750
[Professor]<i> I don't know, but I bet
they'll overlook the 72-hour custody rule.</i>

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.875
[Tokyo] <i>They'll transfer her
at some point.</i>

00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.666
- Can you rescue her?
- <i>We can't do it during a transfer.</i>

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:23.666
It wouldn't be smart.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.476
We did it with you. They would see
it coming, and it would be suicide.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.666
<i>So what are you going to do?</i>

00:17:28.708 --> 00:17:31.548
They have Lisbon with them, and she has
the entire plan inside her head,

00:17:32.041 --> 00:17:34.708
<i>including the place
you're calling me from, Professor.</i>

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.500
Professor?

00:17:45.875 --> 00:17:46.875
I don't know.

00:17:49.208 --> 00:17:50.708
<i>I'm so tired. I can't...</i>

00:17:51.125 --> 00:17:52.541
I can't even think.

00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:57.583
<i>But I'll find a solution.
Don't worry about it.</i>

00:17:57.666 --> 00:17:59.500
[metal clattering]

00:17:59.583 --> 00:18:02.666
[Marseille] I'm making ravioli.
You need all the energy.

00:18:07.833 --> 00:18:08.958
Is Palermo still tied up?

00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:10.750
- Yes.
<i>- I want you to go to him</i>

00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:12.083
and tell him this...

00:18:12.166 --> 00:18:14.250
No, no, no. I'm not telling him anything.

00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:16.583
<i>He'll bite my face like a rabid dog.</i>

00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:19.875
<i>Well you’ll have to. I want you
to say it to him exactly like this...</i>

00:18:20.375 --> 00:18:22.166
"You have a message from the Professor.

00:18:22.666 --> 00:18:24.875
<i>Lisbon is alive.</i>

00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:27.250
She's being held in the tent,

00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:30.000
and I need you
to think of a way to rescue her."

00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:31.333
[scoffs]

00:18:31.416 --> 00:18:33.583
- He won't do it.
- <i>Listen to me, Tokyo.</i>

00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:36.875
The only thing I'm trying to do
is to get Palermo

00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:40.375
<i>to fall back in love with this plan.
I need him to be on our side.</i>

00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:42.916
Go and tell him,
while I think of something else.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.250
Understood?

00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:51.375
Understood.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.000
[Palermo] I'm gonna head to the bathroom.
Would you like to accompany me, Sergio?

00:19:16.791 --> 00:19:19.333
Have you ever had the privilege
of experiencing

00:19:19.416 --> 00:19:21.958
masterful fellatio
from a man with great skill?

00:19:22.041 --> 00:19:23.500
- [Berlin laughs]
- Hmm?

00:19:32.541 --> 00:19:34.166
He's completely unpredictable.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.500
Sergio, he was simply proposing
some fellatio quite gallantly.

00:19:37.583 --> 00:19:39.642
- He doesn't know...
- You know what I’m talking about.

00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:42.041
He's uncontrollable
because he's abnormally egocentric.

00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:43.245
He'll respect the hierarchy.

00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:46.791
He would respect it if the heist
was two hours, or three, or one night.

00:19:47.208 --> 00:19:48.916
We're talking about multiple days,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.750
and he'll be under
higher pressure than usual.

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:54.375
- I can keep Martín under control...
- You can't!

00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:58.416
- Because I've been doing it for years.
- You can't control him. He's an egomaniac.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.333
He's obsessed with being in charge.

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:02.833
And that can only mean one thing.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.916
If it's not him in charge, he'll do
anything he has to do to take control.

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:12.750
And he won't care if he has to execute,
betray or create chaos.

00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:17.791
He's obsessive, egocentric,
trusts his instincts and is a true genius.

00:20:17.875 --> 00:20:18.750
Like you.

00:20:18.833 --> 00:20:20.375
If you prefer mediocre people,

00:20:20.458 --> 00:20:22.791
you'll find plenty here.
They'll follow you like sheep.

00:20:22.875 --> 00:20:25.715
[Professor] Don't you understand
that being a genius complicates things?

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:27.958
He's dangerous
because we won't know what he'll do.

00:20:28.041 --> 00:20:29.500
Listen to me. You're my brother.

00:20:29.583 --> 00:20:33.500
I would put you in charge of any heist
without a shadow of a doubt.

00:20:36.291 --> 00:20:37.291
But him...

00:20:38.166 --> 00:20:41.500
You're wrong about trusting me
and not him. I'm much less reliable.

00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:45.416
[man] Two beers.

00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:53.833
Don't order any more peanuts.

00:20:54.583 --> 00:20:56.875
You're already fatter than an elephant.

00:20:58.166 --> 00:20:59.541
If you laugh at my bow tie,

00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:01.583
you're laughing at me.

00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:03.791
And if you laugh at me, I assure you,

00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:06.625
for the rest of your life,
you'll remember March 17th,

00:21:06.708 --> 00:21:08.625
but you don't know why that is yet.

00:21:10.708 --> 00:21:12.708
Isn't the anticipation just thrilling?

00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:14.916
[chuckles softly]

00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:25.958
Is there a problem?

00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:27.958
[Berlin] Not at all.

00:21:32.916 --> 00:21:35.000
[Alberto] There's fingerprints
all over this place.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
The walls are covered with plans,

00:21:39.083 --> 00:21:41.375
maps, diagrams.

00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:44.625
They have an oven.

00:21:45.375 --> 00:21:47.791
They likely used it
to get rid of evidence.

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:51.750
I'll take it for analysis.

00:22:01.916 --> 00:22:03.666
[Alberto] I see traces of plastic,

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.791
possibly from an electronic device.

00:22:07.125 --> 00:22:09.166
I'm gonna separate the melted parts.

00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:14.750
I think I found something.

00:22:17.625 --> 00:22:18.625
What's wrong?

00:22:18.916 --> 00:22:19.916
Nothing.

00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:27.041
So a Maserati, huh?

00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:31.458
You've gotta be fucking kidding.
Is it out in the newspaper already?

00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:32.666
It's totally fine.

00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:39.309
- I can give you a ride, if you want.
- What the fuck are you saying, Tokyo?

00:22:39.333 --> 00:22:41.166
No big deal.
Just a little ride. That's all.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.250
That's all?

00:22:42.916 --> 00:22:45.791
Then we push a button, erase the tape,

00:22:45.875 --> 00:22:49.958
destroy the evidence,
and there's no record of anything.

00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:04.291
Mónica dumped me.

00:23:04.875 --> 00:23:06.083
I'm a free man.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.166
So I don't need to erase
any fucking black box.

00:23:09.666 --> 00:23:11.666
I'll take the Maserati,
stick my foot on the pedal,

00:23:11.708 --> 00:23:14.458
and I'll start doing 360s
till the tires burn off...

00:23:14.541 --> 00:23:16.101
without a care in the world, beautiful.

00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:17.041
Oh...

00:23:17.125 --> 00:23:18.875
- a reckless driver?
- So reckless.

00:23:18.958 --> 00:23:20.458
So reckless you better be careful,

00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:23.916
or you'll have to take the car to the
mechanics and change the suspension.

00:23:24.583 --> 00:23:26.708
And wait until you see what I do
to the chassis.

00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:29.541
So scary.

00:23:45.708 --> 00:23:48.458
[Tamayo] This bastard
even leaves false clues in his shitter.

00:23:50.125 --> 00:23:51.916
I bet it was put there on purpose.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.351
By the way it was hidden
and melted at the back of the oven,

00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:56.208
it's impossible
it was put there on purpose.

00:23:56.291 --> 00:23:57.291
So then?

00:23:57.333 --> 00:24:00.708
The plastic from the chip
has a recorded number of up to 19 digits,

00:24:00.791 --> 00:24:02.125
unique to each SIM card.

00:24:02.208 --> 00:24:04.500
- Hm-mmm.
- This disappeared during the combustion,

00:24:04.583 --> 00:24:08.416
but it seems that during the process,
it bent and touched the metallic chip,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.583
and it imprinted seven numbers on it.

00:24:10.666 --> 00:24:13.041
We crosschecked it
with data from several phone carriers,

00:24:13.625 --> 00:24:17.666
and we came up with 354 cards
matching those end numbers.

00:24:18.375 --> 00:24:22.583
One of them was bought three months ago
and has only made one call,

00:24:23.083 --> 00:24:24.458
and it was made during the heist.

00:24:24.541 --> 00:24:25.416
Bingo!

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.500
- Where was the call made?
- Wait, wait!

00:24:28.833 --> 00:24:30.083
A little bit of suspense.

00:24:30.916 --> 00:24:32.666
[imitates drum roll]

00:24:33.458 --> 00:24:34.791
[sighs]

00:24:34.875 --> 00:24:36.750
Mindanao, the Philippines.

00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:38.083
Oh, fuck! I knew it!

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.291
We'll talk with Interpol.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
[high energy music]

00:24:49.333 --> 00:24:50.750
[phone rings]

00:24:53.916 --> 00:24:55.726
- Yes?
- [Antoñanzas] <i>Mindanao, the Philippines.</i>

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.750
<i>They know.</i>

00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.833
- [Professor] How?
- A half-burnt SIM card in the ambulance.

00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:14.666
This doesn't change anything for you.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.666
I need you to get to that office now.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:20.083
Show her the watch,
and tell her. "I'm with you."

00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:22.541
That <i>I</i> am?
Should I say it like that?

00:25:22.958 --> 00:25:23.833
Pardon?

00:25:23.916 --> 00:25:25.916
<i>Like that: "I'm with you."
It might be confusing.</i>

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.458
She could think I'm just some weirdo,
or that I'm a communist.

00:25:28.541 --> 00:25:30.583
<i>If I say, "The Professor is with you,"
it's clearer.</i>

00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:32.458
"Is". In third person.

00:25:32.541 --> 00:25:34.666
Benito, just show her the watch
and nothing more.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:35.750
Understood.

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:44.458
Hostages out.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.958
[Matías]
Everybody up and to the stairs!

00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:49.541
How's being in charge, darling?
How are we feeling?

00:25:49.625 --> 00:25:50.833
Magnificent.

00:25:53.833 --> 00:25:55.833
Well, I'm all ears. Go ahead.

00:25:56.958 --> 00:25:59.166
You have the following message
from the Professor:

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.375
"Lisbon is alive.

00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:03.541
She's being held in the tent, and I need
you to think of a way to rescue her."

00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:05.166
It's an order.

00:26:05.958 --> 00:26:08.791
First, you stage a <i>coup d'état.</i>
Now you give me an order.

00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:10.541
That's curious. I'd say that's...

00:26:11.125 --> 00:26:15.708
very dangerous, but then again,
it's understandable, of course.

00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:18.958
Look at them all.
The women are empowered.

00:26:20.833 --> 00:26:22.541
That shit floats to the top

00:26:22.625 --> 00:26:24.583
- then back down the drain.
- All done?

00:26:27.083 --> 00:26:28.500
What happened?

00:26:28.583 --> 00:26:29.583
To me?

00:26:31.541 --> 00:26:33.041
Are you angry with your mama?

00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:37.000
She didn't breastfeed you enough? Hmm?

00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:41.833
So you hate women
because... you need milk desperately?

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.750
Well...

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.500
this order came from the Professor.

00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:52.875
And he has a dick, just like you.

00:26:54.583 --> 00:26:56.500
[tense music playing]

00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:10.375
[Sierra] They're in Mindanao.

00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:14.208
In 24 hours, we'll have them.

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.416
You know how this goes.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.750
Paula comes here,

00:27:18.333 --> 00:27:21.000
you're declared guilty
of abducting your own child,

00:27:21.083 --> 00:27:22.416
you lose your custody,

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:25.083
and she goes to live with her father.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.666
So you're here to tell me I'm fucked?
[sniffs]

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.958
I already know that.

00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:41.416
It depends.

00:27:42.125 --> 00:27:44.458
I'll let you call them.
Right here. Right now.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.791
And you can lead them to safety.

00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:49.708
When we get to your hideout in Mindanao,
they'll be gone.

00:27:49.791 --> 00:27:51.083
We fucked up.

00:27:51.875 --> 00:27:54.166
The thought of Paula
being with that bastard Alberto

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.375
doesn't thrill me either.

00:28:01.125 --> 00:28:02.625
What's Paula doing right now?

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.375
Go on. Close your eyes. Picture her.

00:28:09.583 --> 00:28:10.583
Tucked in bed.

00:28:10.666 --> 00:28:13.750
Her hair across the blanket.
You can almost smell her.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.625
Close your eyes.

00:28:17.375 --> 00:28:18.375
Picture her.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.500
Go on.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.500
What are you doing, Alicia?

00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:29.625
It's only a five-year wait,
and then you'll be reunited again.

00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:31.750
She comes running to you. "Mommy!"

00:28:32.208 --> 00:28:34.666
She hugs you like this,
curled up around you,

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.041
with her arms and legs
like a little monkey.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.458
And you press her against your chest...

00:28:41.916 --> 00:28:43.583
and grab her little face...

00:28:44.416 --> 00:28:45.416
to look at her.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.875
But she won't let you go.

00:28:50.375 --> 00:28:52.166
She repeats over and over,

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.125
like a prayer
that will save her from evil,

00:28:55.208 --> 00:28:56.500
"Mama, don't leave me.

00:28:57.041 --> 00:28:58.625
Mama, don't leave me.

00:28:58.708 --> 00:28:59.958
Mama, don't leave me.

00:29:00.458 --> 00:29:01.916
Mama, don't leave.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.833
Mama, don't leave me."

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.833
Raquel,

00:29:05.916 --> 00:29:08.708
I know you love him, and he loves you too,

00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:09.958
and because of that...

00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:13.291
what do you think he would tell you to do?

00:29:18.583 --> 00:29:19.833
Did I offer you...

00:29:20.958 --> 00:29:22.416
five years in prison?

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.083
I’ll trade it for five minutes.

00:29:28.958 --> 00:29:30.208
I'm offering you freedom.

00:29:31.666 --> 00:29:34.291
Sergio goes to jail, but you go free.

00:29:35.083 --> 00:29:37.375
Your arrest was never official. [chuckles]

00:29:38.791 --> 00:29:40.791
You call them, get them to safety.

00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:43.333
In 24 hours, you'll all be together.

00:29:44.541 --> 00:29:46.208
We'll never come after you.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.000
Everything will be over.

00:29:57.375 --> 00:29:58.541
[sniffles]

00:30:04.666 --> 00:30:06.458
[tense music continues]

00:30:39.125 --> 00:30:40.125
Better?

00:30:40.708 --> 00:30:41.708
Hm-mmm.

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:53.083
[Stockholm] So?

00:30:53.583 --> 00:30:55.333
Were you able to get any sleep?

00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:58.916
I tried to, but I just can't do it.

00:31:01.666 --> 00:31:02.916
Are you having nightmares?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.208
Every time I close my eyes,
I relive it all again.

00:31:20.583 --> 00:31:22.458
So, what happened to the alpha male?

00:31:23.916 --> 00:31:25.416
I thought you were a free man.

00:31:27.125 --> 00:31:29.666
- [Denver] What are they talking about?
- [Tokyo] Oh!

00:31:30.083 --> 00:31:32.083
[as Rio] Hello, beautiful.

00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:34.583
I'd like to bring you to my island.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.416
But only if you don't party all the time.

00:31:37.833 --> 00:31:40.333
I'm not really into chunda-chunda
or dancing, you know?

00:31:43.958 --> 00:31:46.875
If you invite me over,
I'll show you my tiny bikini.

00:31:47.375 --> 00:31:49.750
[both laugh]

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.916
Why didn't you tell us?

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:55.750
I couldn't.

00:31:57.166 --> 00:31:59.500
You need to talk about it, Rio.
It’s important.

00:32:02.125 --> 00:32:04.000
They took me out of my cell at night,

00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:07.875
and forced me
to dig my own grave out in the desert.

00:32:11.708 --> 00:32:14.166
[Tokyo] I'm really really sweet, and...

00:32:14.625 --> 00:32:17.083
that's why I'm smiling
the whole fucking day.

00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:18.208
[Denver laughs]

00:32:18.666 --> 00:32:21.125
Then they made me drag a coffin
in the hole I dug.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.791
Then they forced me to get inside.

00:32:29.708 --> 00:32:31.541
Then they threw sand into the hole.

00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:34.333
[panting]

00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:35.416
Until I was buried.

00:32:38.708 --> 00:32:40.125
And then they left me there.

00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:42.916
[breathing heavily]

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.041
In the darkness.

00:32:46.166 --> 00:32:47.208
In the silence.

00:32:48.041 --> 00:32:50.416
- I could barely breathe.
- Ssh.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.416
- [panting]
- Ssh.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.541
Calm down.

00:32:54.958 --> 00:32:55.958
Breathe.

00:32:58.541 --> 00:32:59.791
I'm here with you.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.166
Do you know what I just kept thinking?

00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:06.416
What?

00:33:07.291 --> 00:33:08.500
That the Professor...

00:33:09.708 --> 00:33:11.916
should be the one inside that coffin,
not me.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.541
I'm sorry.

00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:19.458
[Tokyo, mocking] Look. Oh!

00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:29.291
[Tokyo scoffs]

00:33:34.625 --> 00:33:35.750
Okay, let's go.

00:33:53.458 --> 00:33:56.291
Pardon me for a moment.
I'm going to the restroom.

00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:04.750
You don't trust me.

00:34:12.833 --> 00:34:14.333
I'm an egomaniac.

00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:19.125
I'm only willing to follow my plan.

00:34:20.875 --> 00:34:22.708
I'm so obsessed with being in charge

00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:25.333
if something doesn’t go
according to my plan...

00:34:27.125 --> 00:34:28.916
I could become dangerous, no?

00:34:34.833 --> 00:34:35.833
That's right.

00:34:36.791 --> 00:34:37.958
That's what I believe.

00:34:39.833 --> 00:34:40.833
I'd agree.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.833
But there's one thing
you're not considering.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.333
Not only do I love your brother,

00:34:48.458 --> 00:34:50.291
but I also love the plan,

00:34:50.375 --> 00:34:52.166
and that love is equal.

00:34:52.583 --> 00:34:54.791
I would betray you.
That's perfectly clear.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.083
And the rest of the gang, too.

00:34:57.166 --> 00:34:59.166
But the plan? Never.

00:35:00.416 --> 00:35:02.125
And that's where my loyalty lies.

00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:07.291
This is so much more than a heist,
and you know it.

00:35:08.625 --> 00:35:11.166
Right now, the plan isn't perfect.
I can recognize that.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:12.958
It's an unfinished poem.

00:35:14.583 --> 00:35:16.333
We need you, brother.

00:35:16.416 --> 00:35:19.750
[inhales and exhales deeply]

00:35:20.833 --> 00:35:22.833
[dramatic music playing]

00:35:28.458 --> 00:35:29.458
Please.

00:35:42.666 --> 00:35:43.666
[door closes]

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.416
[light jazz music playing]

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.750
You were very brave out there.

00:35:50.958 --> 00:35:52.250
And that's admirable.

00:35:55.625 --> 00:35:56.791
Very commendable.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.833
Just let me leave, please.

00:36:14.416 --> 00:36:15.500
[laughs softly]

00:36:16.083 --> 00:36:17.375
You seemed brave earlier,

00:36:17.458 --> 00:36:19.750
but now you have to demonstrate
that bravery.

00:36:23.291 --> 00:36:24.666
[groans]

00:36:28.375 --> 00:36:30.041
Let's have a look at those balls.

00:36:30.125 --> 00:36:31.125
[groans]

00:36:31.208 --> 00:36:33.208
Ssh!

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:34.291
Hang in there.

00:36:37.041 --> 00:36:39.750
Hang in there.
And tell me, what do you prefer?

00:36:39.833 --> 00:36:41.208
[groans]

00:36:41.291 --> 00:36:42.291
[Berlin] Death?

00:36:42.875 --> 00:36:44.875
Look at me. Or impotence?

00:36:45.416 --> 00:36:47.517
Sometimes your forced
to make tough decisions in life.

00:36:47.541 --> 00:36:50.750
Mine: what do I do with the asshole
who's making fun of my bow tie?

00:36:50.833 --> 00:36:52.000
Yours:

00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:54.291
is it even worth living without a penis?

00:36:54.375 --> 00:36:55.416
[groans]

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.041
[grunts]

00:36:57.166 --> 00:36:59.166
[light jazz music continues]

00:37:01.875 --> 00:37:03.291
He's taking a long time.

00:37:03.375 --> 00:37:06.208
He’s beating the shit out of the fat guy
in the bathroom.

00:37:07.125 --> 00:37:09.083
I haven't heard any punches
or any other noise.

00:37:10.875 --> 00:37:13.083
Real chaos, my dear Sergio,

00:37:14.583 --> 00:37:15.791
makes no noise.

00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:21.666
[Tokyo] <i>Palermo was loyal to the plan,</i>

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:24.125
<i>but in his mind,
that only meant one thing.</i>

00:37:25.375 --> 00:37:27.000
<i>For the heist to continue,</i>

00:37:27.083 --> 00:37:29.125
<i>he had to be back in charge,</i>

00:37:29.208 --> 00:37:33.208
<i>and to do that, he would quietly
create chaos we never saw coming.</i>

00:37:33.291 --> 00:37:36.208
[whispers] You know what you have to do.
Don't be a coward.

00:37:37.166 --> 00:37:39.250
You have to dislocate the joint

00:37:39.791 --> 00:37:42.958
between the trapezium
and the thumb's first metacarpal

00:37:43.375 --> 00:37:45.291
with strength and determination

00:37:45.833 --> 00:37:47.583
Grab your thumb and twist it.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.208
- No handcuff can stop that.
- [Rio] Ssh.

00:37:51.083 --> 00:37:53.041
Do I have to sit you kids apart,
like in school?

00:38:00.458 --> 00:38:02.125
[Palermo] It'll hurt a tiny bit,

00:38:02.208 --> 00:38:04.708
but your freedom will be worth it.
Don't you think?

00:38:08.416 --> 00:38:09.416
Now do it.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.750
[whimpering]

00:38:27.416 --> 00:38:28.416
[bones crack]

00:38:38.375 --> 00:38:39.708
[hostages gasp]

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.500
[Rio] Don't move!

00:38:49.708 --> 00:38:51.125
- Don't move.
- [Gandía] Easy.

00:38:52.041 --> 00:38:54.000
I'm just a fucking bodyguard.

00:38:54.958 --> 00:38:55.958
On the ground.

00:38:57.666 --> 00:38:59.916
- I can't do that.
- I said on the ground.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.125
What are you going to do?
Are you going to shoot an unarmed man?

00:39:04.958 --> 00:39:07.500
I swear to God,
if I have to, I will shoot you.

00:39:07.583 --> 00:39:11.250
You're gonna kill an unarmed father
with a family who is trying to escape?

00:39:11.666 --> 00:39:13.916
[panting]

00:39:14.375 --> 00:39:15.375
Go on.

00:39:21.333 --> 00:39:22.708
I'm right here.

00:39:22.791 --> 00:39:23.958
Don't move.

00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:25.041
Don't move!

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.625
[shouting] On the ground, Gandía!
On the ground!

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:31.916
You're not gonna shoot.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.458
On the ground!

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.291
[Gandía] Go on.

00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:37.166
For fuck's sake, stop moving!

00:39:38.041 --> 00:39:39.250
Stop moving!

00:39:43.416 --> 00:39:45.875
[panting]

00:39:45.958 --> 00:39:47.208
See you soon.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:50.541
[Rio breathing rapidly]

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.500
[machine beeping]

00:40:07.958 --> 00:40:09.041
[rapid beeping]

00:40:13.875 --> 00:40:15.166
[gasps]

00:40:17.041 --> 00:40:20.791
