WEBVTT

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.000
"Very careful, because the moment
there is a single drop of blood,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.640
we’ll stop being Robin Hoods
and we’ll simply become sons of a bitch."

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.360
Rio, Rio!

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.520
Holy shit, man!

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.400
Holy shit, Tokyo!

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.040
This couldn’t have started,
fucking worse, man!

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.280
Jesus Christ!

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.400
Fuck!

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.760
Let’s see...

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.320
Paula, you need a purple flower there.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.320
Paula.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.080
Paula.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.800
I don’t understand
why dad can’t come tomorrow

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.280
-to my birthday party.
-I already told you, Paula.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.840
A judge took custody away from him
and now it’s me

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.000
-who will take care of you.
-It wasn’t a judge.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.400
-Really?
-No.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.560
And who was that?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.280
It was you. You don’t want him
to come to my party.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.040
Am I right, grandma?

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.120
Huh... Well, listen,
dad and mum are upset now.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.480
-Things will get better, you’ll see.
-Mum, please!

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.160
Inspector.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.760
"Raquel, I know it’s your day off,
but there’s a robbery with hostages.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.400
The robbers tried to go out
with the money, but they couldn’t.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.960
They’ve hurt two officers.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.920
It’s in the Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.880
I want you to take care
of the negotiation."

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.720
-Send me a car.
-"It’s parked outside."

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.960
Explain me what the fucking shit was that!

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.840
Explain me what the fuck was that!
Are you crazy?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.760
8 HOURS OF ROBBERY

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.920
-You’ve riddled two policemen!
-Calm down.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.040
A fucking officer appeared and shot at me.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.920
What would you have done,
would you have spat at him?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.680
-Fucking shit!
-What can you do, man,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.000
what can you do,
stick to the fucking plan, jeez,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.240
we went over it 400 million times.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.600
FRIDAY 6:25 P.M.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.160
We said that,
we weren’t going to shoot anyone.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.520
-I fell, blocked by the impacts...
-Shut up!

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.440
We also covered you,
but shooting at the ground,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.480
not point-blank to their bodies.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.320
They’re taking away the injured officers.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.040
Are the phones connected?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.960
Cut off any wireless or radio signal.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.760
Let’s pass to analogue.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.240
Call the Professor.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.800
What are you wearing?

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.160
What are you wearing?

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.520
What are you wearing?

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.200
-What happened?
-"Two officers were hurt."

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.240
Who shot?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.840
"Tokyo."

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.960
Connect the Professor’s cameras.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.600
"A bullet went near Rio and Tokyo shot."

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.080
It seems they have an affair.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.440
Put her through.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.840
-"What?"
-Is that true?

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.520
-So you have an affair with Rio?
-What the fuck are you saying?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.240
No.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.680
The love of my life died because of me,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.320
the last thing I would think about
is having an affair with a kid.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.680
"I shot to protect myself and my partner."

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.280
And, Mr Professor,
even if you think them over a lot, things

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.240
"don’t always turn out
the way you expect."

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.840
-What happened?
-They opened a vault

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.520
in the Fábrica de Moneda
to take the latest banknotes.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.680
-Why didn’t the alarms set off?
-There was a manual alarm,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.400
-we guess it must have been a worker.
-How many hostages?

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.000
It’s impossible to know,
the museum was open.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.040
Give me a number.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.960
Confirmed: 35 workers, 11 security guards
and 17 children from the British School.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.520
-What the fuck were they doing there?
-It was a school visit.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.200
-Do the media know about it yet?
-No, not yet.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.640
-The robbers?
-We don’t know yet.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.440
We’re getting images
from the nearby shops.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.360
-He’s lost a lot of blood.
-How many can they be?

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.840
Four went outside, we think six at least.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.280
-Weapons?
-We know they have at least three M16.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.160
-And they’re extremely aggressive.
-The GEO are already here.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.000
Yes, they came here in the first place.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.120
Please, give me some good news.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.800
The officers who were shot are alive.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.040
Thank goodness.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.240
Let’s go.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.520
What’s up with the cameras
inside the building?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.360
-Where’s the signal?
-There’s no signal.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.080
-Why not?
-There isn’t, I don’t know.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.920
They must have broken or diverted it.
We’re working on it.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.240
What about the network?

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.080
They cut off the optical fibre,
we can’t hack them.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.520
Listen carefully, all of you,
Police, Civil Protection,

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.080
I want all the phones switched off.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.000
We’re going to use the repeater
on the roof of the building

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.520
in case they make any calls.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.680
I want any phone signal
in the whole perimeter

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.400
to get straight here.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.920
Okay, I want
all the listening analysts here,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.400
in two seconds. All right?

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.720
-Do we have the building layout?
-I’m considering a possible intervention.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.440
Intense "volluto".

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.280
The public servants are
well taken care of.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.480
What the fuck are you doing?

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.160
We have some free time.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.480
They have to set up the camp,
send us a drone,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.280
find the building layout.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.880
We must give them some time
so they organize.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.840
Hey, why did Tokyo say
you’re not together?

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.880
Because we’re not.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.080
Then why did I hear
every night her headboard

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.080
banging like a slide hammer?
Is she learning to dance samba

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.640
-at 5 in the morning?
-I don’t know,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.720
haven’t got a fucking clue. Don’t know
if she dances or she’s restless.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:51.040
Tell me, do I look like a prick to you?
Do you think you can lie to me non-stop?

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.760
I’m kidding.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.520
I would have fucked her, too.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.360
In fact, I might try to.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.000
I think you’re wrong.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.560
I’m very serious with her.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.600
Very serious?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.560
But, seriously as having a garden
and doing home improvement

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.600
-on Sundays?
-That’s right.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.400
And fill it with children.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.520
Sit down.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.400
Look, boy, women will give you sex and fun

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.880
because... they’re programmed
to subdue so you impregnate them.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.280
Later you’ll cease to exist.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.200
During childbirth you’ll notice that.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.360
Childbirth must be the most exciting event
in a father’s life.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.280
In childbirth, whatever comes out
from between her legs

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.080
is a nuclear warhead
that will destroy everything.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.480
First of all, the wonderful cave
where you used to put your thingy

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.800
will never be the same again.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.320
And while she’s cursing you
and asks for the epidural,

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.960
she’ll have a bowel movement.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.640
Do you know what she means by that?

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.840
That she’ll never be a sexy woman again.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.680
And that from now on
that sucker is becoming

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.080
the centre of the universe.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.440
They’re all the same.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.440
Believe me, I’ve had five divorces.
Do you know what five divorces are?

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.080
Five times I believed in love.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.320
What fucking shit
have you got in your head?

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.920
Huh?

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.040
How the hell could Professor
put you in charge?

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.160
Due to my sensitivity dealing with people.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.440
Take the little lamb out of the group
and take her to an office.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.640
And don’t leave her alone.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.800
If she needs to change her towel,
stand next to her.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.920
Okay.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.200
We’ll be back in 30 minutes.
30 minutes, Denver.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200
Excuse me.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.160
Huh... Well, I’m going to jog for a while,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.240
to stretch my legs a bit.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.400
Do it. You have enough space.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.560
Learning a language
is much easier than it seems,

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.680
but you have to lay semantics aside.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.040
Let’s go.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.160
Don’t worry. I’m taking you elsewhere
so you can rest, that’s all.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.120
Okay?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.600
Raquel, all the communications
we keep from the inside

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.000
must be done from this phone
or the radio, not cell phones, okay?

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.520
Put me through with the interior,
I want to talk to the robbers.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.680
Ángel, what the fuck
is colonel Prieto doing here?

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.920
I don’t know. I don’t know.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.240
There are people shooting their guns
in the place where money is made.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.680
Don’t you think Intelligence
should be aware?

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.440
Calling the Fábrica
de Moneda y Timbre, Raquel.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.320
Boss, call to the interior in progress.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.040
"Hello."

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.400
-Good afternoon.
-"I’m Raquel Murillo,"

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.360
the inspector in charge of the robbery.
Who am I talking to?

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.880
"To the robber in charge of the assault."

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.840
-He’s got a voice changer.
-Cleaning the signal.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.920
How are your mates doing?

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.360
So far we haven’t had any casualties.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.160
"I’m glad."

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.040
"Really, sincerely."

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.960
Excuse me, I can’t hear you well.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.920
Yes, I’m sorry about
this hateful metallic voice,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.640
"but you must understand
I have to protect my identity,"

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.520
just in case one day you give us
a helicopter and we go to Brazil.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.200
Is that what you want, a helicopter?

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.480
"What I want right now
is to negotiate with someone"

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.840
who doesn’t give us the runaround,
who doesn’t need to ask a superior,

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.040
Intelligence or their mum
to give me a yes or a no.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.920
Then you should talk to the president,
but since he’s busy running the country,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.320
I’ll try to stand in for him,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.800
"if you don’t mind."

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.360
-Any further questions?
-"Yes."

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.800
What are you wearing?

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.080
-Pardon?
-"What are you wearing?

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.560
Don’t you think our clothes"

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.400
say a lot about our personality?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.120
Look, I have no objection
to answer your question,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.160
but I think I should inform you

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.120
"this conversation is being heard
by several members

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.000
of the UDEF, the UIT, the CNI"

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.240
and their liaison office, the chief
of the GEO and some other officers.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.840
In that case, I think I should say hello
and introduce myself.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.960
It’s nice to meet you.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.680
"I regret I can’t tell you my name,
but you can call me"

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.840
Professor, everybody calls me so.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.680
Hello. I’m Ángel,
Deputy Inspector of Police.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.840
Nice to meet you, Ángel.
How are you doing?

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.240
-"Hello, good morning."
-Good morning.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.720
Hello, how are you?

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.760
Very well. I’m very well,
thanks a lot. And you?

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.320
After this emotional moment, tell me,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.800
-what do you want?
-Time...

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.400
"to try and clarify things.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.000
Listen to me, Inspector.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.640
We couldn’t go out only for
a matter of seconds, but we’re"

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.120
perfectly ready to defend ourselves,

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.920
"so try to avoid
any kind of intervention."

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.200
-Can I trust you?
-Of course.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.440
But in order for me to trust you,
you must make a gesture towards me.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.000
Release those children from the school,
they’re minors.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.760
Everything will be much better that way.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.000
But, Inspector, you still
haven’t told me what you’re wearing.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.640
A grey suit jacket, a blue shirt,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.680
"black high heel boots and..."

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.760
Well, I think so far that’s enough, right?

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.200
"So I can picture you a lot better."

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.720
But, Inspector, a suit jacket for women
can have a skirt or trousers,

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.600
"so I’ll ask you that next time you are"

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.680
a bit more specific.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.080
Let me think about your request.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.680
Tell me, what sort of lunatic
with 60 hostages

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.560
thinks about teasing his negotiator?

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.760
No, he’s too calm to be a lunatic.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.960
I want helicopters flying
all day long over their heads!

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.240
No food, water or any other type
of request. Am I clear?

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.880
Excuse me, Inspector.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.720
Just because you leave them without
dessert I don’t think they’ll surrender.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.080
Both the chief of the GEO,
here present, and me

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.960
believe it’s necessary
an immediate intervention.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.960
If they wanted a massacre
like in Moscow’s Opera House,

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.000
they’d have called you straightaway,

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.600
but unfortunately
you’re here only to opine and bug.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.080
Please, Inspector,
don’t be on the defensive.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.560
I’m here to help you.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.960
I know you’re not going
through your best moment.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.160
If you mean my period, it’s not the case,
but thanks for asking.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.680
I mean the complaint of ill-treatment
you’ve filed against your ex-husband.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.920
Wow, I see Intelligence
did their homework.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.600
There isn’t a single room
where they don’t stick their nose, right?

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.480
Internal Affairs also do it.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.920
They think you’ve brought a false report.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.040
Your ex-husband has rebuilt his life

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.640
both personally and professionally
in the police,

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.960
but some women don’t always turn the page.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.000
Look, I don’t know if you’re miserable

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.760
or... just stupid.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.080
If somebody’s interested
in my personal life,

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.040
I must say
that matter has been totally got past

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.600
and it’s in the hands of a judge.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.560
Thanks for your sensitivity, colonel.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.240
There’s an incoming call
in the museum’s repeater.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.400
-Record it.
-Yes, we’re recording.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.200
Turn up the volume. Silence, please!

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.560
-"Why aren’t you coming for dinner?
-I’m working.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.080
My apologies to your mother and sister.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.320
-Why aren’t you coming?"

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.880
There’s a good mess here.
My apologies to them. Believe me.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.400
-Don’t yell at me, honey, please.
-Almansa!

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.280
I have to go, okay, sweetheart?

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.880
Okay, I love you so much. Bye.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.160
Cut.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.360
It’s Almansa.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.960
Why did you bring me here?

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.360
No, don’t worry.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.760
They brought me here to protect you.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.480
Just that.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.560
When you get naked, please,
put on the red overalls.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.400
Fine.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.960
What if it goes wrong?

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.760
-What’s up if it goes wrong?
-Well, darling,

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.240
the usual things: back in prison,

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.320
the cigarette in the yard,
four langoustines at Christmas,

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.160
-the vis-à-vis, sometimes.
-A real luxury.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.560
It’s worst if it goes well. What the fuck
are we going to do with so much dough?

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.240
I’ll buy a Maserati,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.480
the colour of a clear blue sky, huh?

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.760
-Sure.
-And a martial arts gym.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.080
I can see it.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.680
And a bar, with three floors, huh?

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.840
With loudspeakers
that make your ears bleed.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.160
-Boom, boom, pam, pim pam pum.
-Sure.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.240
-He’s got enough with three million.
-And a pair of lungs for you,

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.040
because you fucked them up in the mine.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.560
Are you spending your money
on a pair of lungs?

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.080
Good heavens!

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.480
And where the fuck
are you going to find some lungs?

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.480
Some people sell their kidneys.
There must be people who sell lungs,

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.440
I think.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.720
Well, I... a winery in Provence.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.040
A hundred hectares of vineyards
to cultivate my own wine,

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.560
-oak casks...
-But, man, you can go to any supermarket

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.600
and buy whatever
fucking bottle you want.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.120
-Why do you want a winery?
-For the art.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.040
Well, I want an island.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.560
-I want another one.
-And a third one.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.440
-Three’s a crowd.
-An archipelago.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.640
No, I want a little island
that has a huge house,

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.960
you know?, with a small balcony
next to the sea.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.600
I’ll wake up every morning
and dive into the water.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.880
At last someone’s intelligent.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.320
I think some of us have to sort

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.400
some things out first, right?
Well, at least I have.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.040
And then, with what’s left,
I’ll buy a plane.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.400
-And I’ll pilot it.
-You could have a hot pilot.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.760
No, you don’t get it,
the best thing is to show off

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.200
at the man at the control tower:
"I need a runway

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.520
to go to Broadway."

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.480
If we buy all those things
let’s say for a price...

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.560
I don’t know, an expensive price,
a very expensive price.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.280
However, we’d still have
a lot of money left.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.080
If we’re robbing big,

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.800
dream big.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.480
I’d record an album, singing "corridos".

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.280
And my face on the cover.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.520
You’ll be like Bertín Osborne,
but 30 kilos fatter.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.320
-Whoa!
-What are you saying?

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.480
Bertín sings "rancheras",
I said "corridos",

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.960
it’s very different.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.200
Show him what a "corrido" is, dad.
Show him.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.600
-No way...
-Come on.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.880
-Come on!
-Come on, man.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.480
-But you love it.
-I’m not going to sing!

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.720
-Sing, sing.
-He’s stood up.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.840
"Because I didn’t have your lips
I cried for the first time"

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:29.640
"And I cursed knowing you
to not stop loving you"

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.680
"I wanted to make you my wife"

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.920
"I looked for luck loveless"

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.080
"I took out my gun"

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.200
"And fate brought death"

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.840
"María, my life, my love"

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.480
"I won’t stop loving you"

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.320
"I lost you due to bullets"

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.880
"You won’t see me again"

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.120
Stand up.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.400
Come on, come on.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.960
Take out your masks.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.400
Take out your masks!

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.720
What’s the matter?

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.720
We’re going to be good.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.600
Something has come up,

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.280
but, in spite of helicopters,

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.800
I’m aware we’re going
to have some quiet hours

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.920
and you’ll be able to rest.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.400
In a few minutes
we’ll give you sleeping bags,

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.760
water and a sandwich.
Oh, and let me ask you a favour.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.640
I want you to get naked.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.440
I want to give you red overalls like ours

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.360
so you feel more comfortable.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.360
Excuse me, sir,
I don’t want to bother you.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.640
Among these people there are people
with heart conditions,

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.280
pregnant women, diabetics, teenagers...

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.920
I beg you, please,
release those who are more vulnerable.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.560
I don’t think they can stand
this anguish all night long.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.040
-Do you think you’re fucking Gandhi?
-Denver, calm down.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.120
He’s a friend of mine.
We share our love for cinema.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.520
Take the gun.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.680
I’m not asking you if you want,

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.320
I’m telling you to take the gun.
Take the gun. Take the gun.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.480
-And now aim at me.
-No, please.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.080
I’m telling you to aim at me.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.320
A fucking order. Aim at me, jeez.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.840
-Here. Fine.
-No, please.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.040
And now you shoot me.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.480
-Pardon?
-Shoot me.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.800
-Shoot me.
-Please.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.640
-Please, no!
-Either you shoot me

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.640
or I’ll shoot you. I give you ten seconds.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.920
One, two, three, four, five,

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.280
six, seven, eight, nine...

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.960
They’re fake, Arturito,
but you did very well.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.280
You did very well.
It’s a present, you can keep it.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.120
Now we’re giving you some fake guns.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.640
In a few hours
we’ll need your cooperation.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.440
As you’ve seen, the only thing
you have to do is obey.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.760
Trust us... and obey.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.480
Come on, get naked.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.720
Come on.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.960
"What are you wearing?"

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.400
Raquel, no walkie-talkie, no phones,
no electronic devices.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.920
We haven’t located
any radiofrequency inside.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.280
Are you telling me they communicate
using an empty yogurt and a string

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.640
-so we don’t detect them?
-I don’t know if it’s a yogurt

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.360
or it’s a gang of deaf-mutes,
but we can’t find any frequencies.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.760
What the fuck are
those armoured vehicles doing here?

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.320
We’re getting in with everything.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.520
That’ll be if I give the order.
I’m in charge but I still haven’t done it.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.080
They’re orders from above.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.680
Is anyone going to tell me
what the fuck is going on here

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.080
or do I have to phone
the Minister of Interior Affairs?

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.240
-What the fuck is going on?
-Let’s go.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.800
Inside there’s a priority 1 person.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.280
-Do you know what "priority 1" is?
-No.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.840
I’m not with your Intelligence gang,
I don’t know.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.680
They’ll get in. They’ll get in
because we have our little lamb.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.440
Alison Parker.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.520
"Sir Benjamin Parker’s daughter.
he’s the UK ambassador"

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.880
and a close friend
to the Queen of England.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.080
That’s why we have no choice
but getting in,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.400
because, if we don’t do it now,
the whole country will know tomorrow.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.360
They’ll think we don’t know.
They’ll think they managed to hide

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.960
all that information
from the public opinion.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.920
Today she’s just another hostage,
but tomorrow she’ll be the main bullseye

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.440
and all the guns will aim at her head.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.640
Is that what you want? Huh?

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.480
That’s why they’ll get in the first night.
And they’ll do it before 04:15 am.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.080
Because at 6:30 begins to get light.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.280
Do you imagine what it’d be
for Spain a hostage crisis

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.120
managed by the United Kingdom?

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.560
And it’s better
if they don’t hesitate to get in

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.800
because then we’ll have more possibilities
to win the first battle.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.880
Inspector Murillo,

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.480
we’re getting in now
and we’re taking out that girl alive.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.000
I have to talk to you...
You’ve ignored me all the time.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.320
Shut up, they’ll kill us all
and it’s your fault.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.120
Sorry.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.600
It seems you don’t like
your boss much, right?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.400
How do you know he’s my boss?

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.720
Because I know everything about you.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.480
I’ve studied that.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.880
I’ve also seen the pregnancy test
on your table.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.720
And now I guess who the father must be.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.520
He didn’t like the present.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.840
What did he say?

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.000
He doesn’t want to deal with it?

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.080
It’s not easy saying goodbye to a baby.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.240
What are you going to do?

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.600
Abort.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.360
Intervention units 1, 2 and 3, ready.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.080
-We’re getting in.
-Let’s go!

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.800
-Come on, come on!
-"Teams 1, 2 and 3, ready."

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.840
Now.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.640
Team 1, hidden at the front door.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.640
Watch the flat roof and the high flanks.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.400
Hello?

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.720
Berlin,

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.080
-they’re getting in.
-There we go.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.120
People, the time has come!

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.840
It’s the moment to follow my orders!

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.960
Follow us.

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:25.040
"And that’s how the State security forces

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.280
did exactly what the Professor
told us they’d do,

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.440
only that afternoon, when he said that,

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.200
we were in the countryside
and we didn’t have the feeling

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.200
they were going to shoot us in the head."

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.360
They’ll get in through the four places
they can use to access:

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.960
the main door, the load area,
the emergency exit and the rooftop.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.360
Watch the rearguard
of the overtaken doors.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.440
Don’t let anyone out.

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.520
But they’ll wait. They’ll wait
for Technical Intervention officers

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.440
to examine the place.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.040
They’ll do that from the load access.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.480
Come on, come on.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.600
Come on, they’re already at the door.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.760
Okay?

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.800
Insert the periscope.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.880
Let’s go.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.680
Raquel, there’s an incoming call
from one hostage’s phone,

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.800
Alison Parker.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.440
"As you know, a group of kidnappers..."

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.480
Turn it up.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.080
"We have another listener
on the phone to give us her opinion.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.160
I’m not a listener.
I’m a hostage and I’m kidnapped."

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.480
My name’s Alison Parker. I’m the United
Kingdom’s ambassador’s daughter.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.280
-Live, in Onda Cero.
-"I’m calling you"

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.520
from the interior
of the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.400
End that call right now!

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.280
-Now! End it now!
-End the call!

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.520
We’re dressed just like the kidnappers.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.200
Colonel, we have images.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.200
What the fuck is that?

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.720
They gave us guns
and we’re wearing the same masks.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.320
-Enlarge. Stop there.
-Nobody knows who is who.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.960
-He’s got a Browning machine gun.
-Motherfuckers.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.480
If the police come in,
innocents will get hurt.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.080
Entrenched with the hostages,
all with the same clothes.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.360
It’s impossible to know
who they’re going to shoot.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.480
-Don’t get in.
-Stop this, Suárez.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.160
Stop it!

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
-Don’t get in, for God’s sake.
-Stop it.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.040
Abandon positions. Abort the operation.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.400
Inspector...

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.120
Finish what you started, colonel.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.120
I don’t want to have
anything to do with this.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.920
"And that’s how we won our first battle
the first night there,

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.920
without entering a combat
and thanks to common sense.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.920
And 20 minutes later...

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.160
we started to do what we were there for."

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.440
This is the nicest part,
we’re going to work.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.080
With me:

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.640
Torres, Sánchez, Biedma,

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.320
"Lennon,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Guatsani,

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.800
Molina, García,

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.760
Domingo, De Gorza, Mateo."

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.040
Come on, that way.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.560
"Rodrigo, Molla, Pérez."

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.200
Come on.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.480
Listen, I want the machines working

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.080
24 hours a day,
as if it was one of Pocholo’s raves.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.080
You know what I mean?

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.800
"Every time we stop we’ll lose a million,
so we’re not stopping."

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.080
We’ll do the technical amendments
every three hours,

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.680
"both from the ink and the offset."

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.000
So you know: joy, party and excitement.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.800
"The best paid job ever:

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.000
2,400 million euros, maybe more.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.800
It all depended on the time
we could hold on inside."

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.280
Oh my goodness! This is wonderful, man!

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.320
This is wonderful, "coquinoqui"!

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.600
Our money, man!

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.520
Jeez!

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.320
We’re making our own dough, people!

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.680
Can I have a decaf, please?

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.920
"Hello. This is Mariví’s
answering machine.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.160
When you hear the beep,
you can leave a message."

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.920
Mum, I’ve just finished, it’s six...

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.560
-Excuse me, do you have a phone charger?
-No.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.600
Do you want to use mine?

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.760
Really? Don’t you mind?

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.640
-No.
-Are you sure?

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.120
Thanks.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.880
I have to make a couple of calls.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.360
-It’s all right.
-Thanks a lot.
